# Adventure 5: Corruption in the river

The party have just solved a plot whereby the SKRC were intending to steal technology from Haven in the form of blueprints, manifests and instructions. They killed two Whispers agents, Zesstra and Kored, but did not manage to question either. The Austenite Spire mole was apprehended, transpiring to be **Oppius Congalla**.

In the few days afterwards, the party were invited to view Oppius’ trial, where they learned his motivation was a belief that Haven should be adopting a more expansionist policy to take advantage of its technological advancement. 

The patrician then invited them to the Founder’s Apartments, where they met **Paelias** and **Grimnir**, the two surviving founders of Haven. Paelias, very old even for an elf, spoke of a time when northern Kvenland was a thick wood, inhabited by wood elves and drow the Underdark. He described the beginning of Death worship, how the cult slowly grew in the shadows of society, and how it rose up to destroy the ancestral home of the drow by burning it in a near-cataclysmic event.

 Soldan sought the help of Half-Orc researcher Geirre Allirson, specialist of planes and dimensions, and learned that his newfound amulet was formed of *shadow stuff*, a material found in the Shadowfell, a demiplane that brushes up against the Material in certain parts of the underdark.

The party all participated in boxing matches at The Broken Axe, to great success. They were then invited to take a ship, *Stormchaser*, and explore the waterways surrounding the city. Among the crew are Arathys, the businesslike first-mate and former crewmember of Freya’s, Drex, her happy-go-lucky brother, who you learned is a little slow, but has incredible talent as a navigator. Also aboard are Anders, a rather pompous attaché from the Research Group who specialises in palentology and horticulture, and Kolos, a researcher conducting projects in weather manipulation.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

Was a wanderer before coming to Haven. This part is still in flux. 

Did a stint in the Winter Cavalry. Had some adventures with Epimetheus (Leonin) and Aleos (Tiefling). These included investigating the remains of a settlement, and showing the Guild of Arran where to find some Glacier Toads.

Then got called to investigate the mole in the Austenite Spire for Keystone. Has a classmate named Cora (Halfling, v clever).

Wants to explore the ice, learn more about Meili, and find some cool magic items. Also wants to know why people were hunting Tabaxi. Has Wanderlust.

Adam likes pulling off sneaky shenanigans, feeling like he’s winning, and cool loot.

### Twister [ Henri ]

Ancient war-robot re-activated by Hannah. Trained in the Radiant Hall, showed talent as an Artificer. Supervised by Nellote, a high elf who helped her build Rascal. Has assistants Tangle and Baskin (Donovan and Powell), who help her build her gadgets.

Wants to discover where they come from. Wants to work towards building new Warforged.

Henri enjoys silly roleplay and tense moments…I think.

### Soldan [ Cian ]

Drow. Grew up wanting to join the *Whispers* after his mother. Shunned due to only being half-drow. Eventually they started a disposable-soldier program powered by a warlock in the Shadowfell. He joined, a job went wrong when they were sent to kill a powerful lord, and he fled to Haven. 

Wants to find out more about his patron and the Shadowfell. Wants to take down the Whispers.

Items:

- Rod of the Pactkeeper (+1 to attack rolls, regain spell slot 1/day)
- Rakdos Guild Signet (charged with hellish rebuke x3)
- Protection item (eg cloak of protection, +1ac/saving)
- Better armour (Mithril half-plate?)
- +1 weapon/shield?
- Cool Whispers “tactical” stuff

Cian loves DnD. He equally enjoys rich backstory/storyline segments, silly roleplay and challenging combat.

### Torvald [ Truman ]

Human, high protector in Haven. Brought as a baby, son of an ice-mining specialist. Stickler for procedure. Spends his time doing paperwork and fighting at the broken axe. Wants to discover how Scragga found his ship and avenge them. 

Items:

- Better heavy armour
- I think a belt of dwarvenkind would be awesome and on-brand -> “damaged” one without the +2 con in the fortress, which gets repaired in Themisson’s Deep
- Have plans to give *Righteous Dawn* at some point.

Truman likes roleplaying his character, and having them fit into the story well.

## Strong Start

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

### What’s happening?

The players are about to leave on their first excursion and are loading up the ship. Just as they’re finishing, they hear shouts and crashes coming from outside. A pair of [River Kraken](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_prGk-4hV6Ua42Jw1GtH4d_0ZDwzXEv5/view) are attacking the fishing ships in the Cobalt Passage.

### What’s the point?

After the action is over, it is noted that it is unusual for them to come this close to the sea. It is likely something drove them this far east - worth investigating [from Anders]. This gives the party some purpose, rather than aimlessly setting sail.

### Where’s the action?

Saving the sailors! The party will have to balance their resources between addressing the threat of the kraken and picking up survivors. Given enough time *Fading Twilight* will come out of the docks and blast them. This will need:

- Cobalt Passage battle map
- Fishing ship token
- Fading Twilight ship token
- Kraken in roll20
- Drowning sailor token

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1:

While sailing along, the PCs have a few “view only” encounters: 

- A huge ice wyrm swims through the wall next to the ship. Anders explains how they swim through ice: there’s a temperature gradient along their body. Their head melts the ice ahead, they swim through the water, and the skin around their tail re-freezes it on the other side, so they’re always encased in a tiny pocket of water.
- A shark with horrendous mutations floats, dead, down the river past the ship.

### Scene 2:

The PCs arrive at a spot where the ice forms a tunnel over the river. It looks like it could have been going under some sort of castle at one point. There’s a blockage in there; a long-destroyed ship is in the way and looks difficult to shift. The PCs will need to climb out and go through the decrepit cellars (now a spider lair) to clear it.

### Scene 3:

Strong perception checks will reveal a herd of ice-half-orgres (7) following the ship along the shore. At one point, the herd will attempt to ambush the ship. Nets are pulled from the water in front of and behind the vessel, trapping it in a short stretch of waterway where the the river narrows substantially. Goliaths will begin to throw rocks at the ship, and lay a great, heavy walkway from the shore in an attempt to board it. -> **Kron**

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. There’s slivers of corruption in the water. The slivers have been getting more frequent over time, and started some months ago.
2. The OverWood was once the centre of a large wood-elf population in Skara. The remains of their great capital can still be found to the north.
3. This is Anders’ first “field outing”. He’s very interested in research but up until now has been too afraid to join expeditions and has contented himself in working at the Monstrous Miscellany. He joined this expedition because it sounded safer.
4. Kolos’ clan come from far to the south, near the tip of Orlorthon. He had a disagreement with some of his clanmates and elected to leave. He doesn’t want to talk about it. He travelled up the coast, and, after being wrecked by an SKRC patrol, was picked up by a Haven merchant ship. 
5. Arathys and Drex are long-serving crewmates of Freya’s. They bear the same Dragoon tattoo she does. After a good amount of action and an ill-commanded campaign to secure the Whitespire straits, Freya convinced her crew to defect and took *Fading Twilight* up north, in the hope of finding where so many of the mysterious merchant ships she saw went.
6. Twister’s 1st war flashback
7. Soldan has a vision of the Shadowfell: a huge labyrinth splays out at the foot of a mountain. High above, a series of great towers is built into its side. The fringes of the vision are played by some sort of dark fog, distinct from the darkness of the demiplane. As play progresses, these will continue, with the fog increasing in severity as Sorrow tightens their grip on Shadowfell.
8. Creatures that live in the Fyrkatt surface are being driven south by something in the region of the volcano. An evil force appears to have been manifesting there. Goliath typically stay to mountainous regions, far like those on the northern coast.
9. There’s a volcano in the Dragonspine mountains up north. It has been silent for a long while, and has recently started to billow smoke again
10. 

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

### Necrotic tree(ant)

Deep in the water wood, a huge, dead, willow drapes over the river. The corruption in the water is pooling underneath it, and dark veins of it run up the trunk. It is a Sythe Tree (Fifth Edition Foes, 198) that has been consuming the corruption and those caught within it. It will attack the players if they investigate. Destroying it will reveal a wand of entangle.

### Frozen Quarry

Out on the runestone plateau, an old, abandoned quarry looms out of the mist. *Detect Magic* will reveal the stone here glows softly with raw magic. This is where the Inalin got the stone to build the rune circle to the south - the first of the gateways.

The runestone plateau itself is infested with undead. The quarry is no exception - wights wander all over it, and two spectral trolls (Fifth Edition Foes, 234) patrol further in. 

### Dokkufu’s Lair

### Runestone circle



### Shrine to Shar

Herd of Yeti

### Forgotten Tower

Contains a Blue Arcanian (Critter Compendium pg 9)

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

- Abomination from the Deep (Nerzugal pg 3)
- Fanged sea serpent (5th edition foes, 201)
- Spitting sea serpent (5th edition foes, 204)

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
