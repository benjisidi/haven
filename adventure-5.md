# Adventure 5: Corruption in the river

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

Was a wanderer before coming to Haven. This part is still in flux. 

Did a stint in the Winter Cavalry. Had some adventures with Epimetheus (Leonin) and Aleos (Tiefling). These included investigating the remains of a settlement, and showing the Guild of Arran where to find some Glacier Toads.

Then got called to investigate the mole in the Austenite Spire for Keystone. Has a classmate named Cora (Halfling, v clever).

Wants to explore the ice, learn more about Meili, and find some cool magic items. Also wants to know why people were hunting Tabaxi. Has Wanderlust.

Adam likes pulling off sneaky shenanigans, feeling like he’s winning, and cool loot.

### Twister [ Henri ]

Ancient war-robot re-activated by Hannah. Trained in the Radiant Hall, showed talent as an Artificer. Supervised by Nellote, a high elf who helped her build Rascal. Has assistants Tangle and Baskin (Donovan and Powell), who help her build her gadgets.

Wants to discover where they come from. Wants to work towards building new Warforged.

Henri enjoys silly roleplay and tense moments…I think.

### Soldan [ Cian ]

Drow. Grew up wanting to join the *Whispers* after his mother. Shunned due to only being half-drow. Eventually they started a disposable-soldier program powered by a warlock in the Shadowfell. He joined, a job went wrong when they were sent to kill a powerful lord, and he fled to Haven. 

Wants to find out more about his patron and the Shadowfell. Wants to take down the Whispers.

Items:

- Rod of the Pactkeeper (+1 to attack rolls, regain spell slot 1/day)
- Rakdos Guild Signet (charged with hellish rebuke x3)
- Protection item (eg cloak of protection, +1ac/saving)
- Better armour (Mithril half-plate?)
- +1 weapon/shield?
- Cool Whispers “tactical” stuff

Cian loves DnD. He equally enjoys rich backstory/storyline segments, silly roleplay and challenging combat.

### Torvald [ Truman ]

Human, high protector in Haven. Brought as a baby, son of an ice-mining specialist. Stickler for procedure. Spends his time doing paperwork and fighting at the broken axe. Wants to discover how Scragga found his ship and avenge them. 

Items:

- Better heavy armour
- I think a belt of dwarvenkind would be awesome and on-brand
- Have plans to give *Righteous Dawn* at some point.

Truman likes roleplaying his character, and having them fit into the story well.

## Strong Start

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

### What’s happening?

The players are about to leave on their first excursion and are loading up the ship. Just as they’re finishing, they hear shouts and crashes coming from outside. A pair of [River Kraken](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_prGk-4hV6Ua42Jw1GtH4d_0ZDwzXEv5/view) are attacking the fishing ships in the Cobalt Passage.

### What’s the point?

After the action is over, it is noted that it is unusual for them to come this close to the sea. It is likely something drove them this far east - worth investigating [from Anders]. This gives the party some purpose, rather than aimlessly setting sail.

### Where’s the action?

Saving the sailors! The party will have to balance their resources between addressing the threat of the kraken and picking up survivors. Given enough time *Fading Twilight* will come out of the docks and blast them. This will need:

- Cobalt Passage battle map
- Fishing ship token
- Fading Twilight ship token
- Kraken in roll20
- Drowning sailor token

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1:

While sailing along, the PCs have a few “view only” encounters: 

- A huge ice wyrm swims through the wall next to the ship. Anders explains how they swim through ice: there’s a temperature gradient along their body. Their head melts the ice ahead, they swim through the water, and the skin around their tail re-freezes it on the other side, so they’re always encased in a tiny pocket of water.
- A shark with horrendous mutations floats, dead, down the river past the ship.

### Scene 2:

The PCs arrive at a spot where the ice forms a tunnel over the river. It looks like it could have been going under some sort of castle at one point. There’s a blockage in there; a long-destroyed ship is in the way and looks difficult to shift. The PCs will need to climb out and go through the decrepit cellars (now a spider lair) to clear it.

### Scene 3:



## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. There’s slivers of corruption in the water
2. The OverWood was once the centre of a large wood-elf population in Haven
3. 
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
