- **Joraine** is in the forest nearby, tending to a herd of elasmotherum
- He was on the council with **Sedna** [Selvesh]
- He is a Chronurgy/Dunamancy wizard with strong controls over time & gravity

### Missing Loxodon

- Eavesdropping will tell the players that the two are from the Glittering Sands, that they had a third companion (a Loxodon named Chara) who is dead
- Proceeding up the road will cause one of the two (Jon) to call for aid, while the other (Laire) tries to shush him and hide
- Talking to them will reveal that they are traders from the glittering sands, that had the idea of going to Kvenland via the Djemorah Pass to pick up some different goods, and arrive at Evenstad with fresher wares. They were recently in Strunah, where one of their party, Chara, vanished. They stayed for a few days to look for her but eventually had to move on. 
- Helping them with the cart (removing it from the rut, fixing the wheel and providing them with some sort of mount) will reward the party with Chara's potion of fire breathing.

### Dreams

- Nightmares from the fissures

> *And the dark one will come fourth from the wound in the earth and if he be pleased with our sacrifices all shall grovel at his master's feet*
