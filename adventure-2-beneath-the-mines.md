## Funerary Room / Altar to Death

> You find yourselves in a largeish square room, dominated by what is clearly an altar. A long stone block stands in the centre, behind which a 10ft tall statue of **Mictlantecuhtli:** God of death, is down on one knee on a plinth. Emaciated human form with a skull for a head. Golden circlet holds a smaller skull above his head, and an elaborate headdress of dark green and black feathers. Holds a bronze human heart in one hand, and a small, heavily tapered bronze dagger in the other. The plinth says DEATH on it. Smith's body lies on the plinth. His throat has been cut and the blood has run down channels carved in the stone to fill the impression of a skull in the floor in front of the plinth. Alcoves holding smaller statues line the walls:
>
> - **Tlaloc:** God of rain and storms. Vertical blue bands along the alcove wall. What was once a bright blue hawk-headed figure with huge eyes, circled by runes, wears a crown.
> - **Tonatiuh:** God of the sun. Rays emanate from a golden quarter circle in one corner of his alcove. An ape-headed figure stands with a human heart in one hand and a bird in the other. A python circles his neck. He sticks out a pointed, triangular tongue inscribed with a golden rune in the form of an eye.
> - **Tezcatlipoca:** *The Smoking Mirror* - God of night. Alcove is jet black, slightly mirrored. Obsidian-skinned figure with the head and claws of a jaguar 
> - **Quetzalcoatl:** *The Feathered Serpent* - Patron of Knowledge and Learning. Silver alcove, Jade serpent figure with a bronze mane of feathers.

## Library

In here, the walls are lined with ancient books. Warrior figures stand on columns, adorned in feathers and carrying large, oval shields and spears. On one wall, a faded mural depicts 'Naji slaughtering their enemies on the battlefield in one scene, sacrificing a line of victims atop a pyramidal temple in another. A DC14 investigation check reveals one particularly interesting book: *The Tenochtitlan Codex*. This talks of a great 'Naji city, Tenochtitlan, and The Fourth Great War with a nation/nations referred to only as the Group/Alliance/Federation (The Consortium). 

A second book (DC17) is, surprisingly, in common, and appears to be a captured Consortium text. It describes the 'Naji in battle - their refusal to surrender, regardless of odds of success. If subdued, captured 'Naji took their own life rather than face the shame of imprisonment by the enemy.

## Orrery/Astronomy Room



## Sacrifice Room



## Challenge Room: Valour



## Challenge Room: Intellect

ROOM 1: As the PCs enter, they find themselves in tiny room not much larger than a wardrobe. Turning around, they'll find a stone wall. On the wall facing them, it says *To progress, you must go back*. Walking backwards at the far wall, players will find themselves in room 2

ROOM 2: is a corridor that bends out of sight about 40 ft away. It is an inescapable loop. The corridor is lined with braziers with symbols over them. The floor has an (infinitely repeating) clue written along it, which points to which braziers must be lit to escape the loop.

ROOM 3: is a vast chasm, with light spilling out of a door far in the distance. It is perfect blackness, apparently infinitely far up and down, and extends to the right and left arbitrarily far. Along the parapet is inscribed *Faith is absolute* over and over. The PCs must take a meaningful step into the void, with all their weight on it, upon which they will discover they can simply walk to the door.

## Aftermath

> The patrician sighs. *It appears you have averted a catastrophe beyond the scope of anything we had imagined. Guildmaster MAGIC has inspected the area and believes it has been leaking magic into the city for a long time. It is just a theory, but a deeply unsettling one.*
>
> He hesitates at his desk for a moment. *What I am about to show you must under no circumstance reach the citizens of the city. I don't know if the city would survive if it did.* He picks up a large roll of translucent paper and walks over to the fireplace. Above it hangs an ornate map of Haven, showing the districts and some of the main buildings but lacking most of the detail of the modern city.
>
> *This map dates to the founding of the districts and the building of the Furnace, more than 150 years ago.*
>
> Slowly, he unfurls the translucent paper and smooths it out over the map. It shows a drawing of the throne room door you opened.
>
> The central skull lays perfectly over the furnace. Each of the districts aligns with one side of the octagonal door, and one of the promised gifts:
>
> - Reinhardt - *Power*
> - Aleph - *Riches*
> - Underflow - *Conquest*
> - Jura - *Knowledge*
> - Heath - *Protection*
> - Febris - *Plenty*
> - Bast - *Rulership*
> - Lustre - *Desire*
>
> *It seems whatever was under here has been shaping our civilization, possibly since its very inception. I dread to think what the entities below were waiting for, or what they would have done when it arrived. While you seem to have eliminated the immediate danger, I doubt this is the last we will hear of the 'Naji. We must remain vigilant, always. The city is in your debt.*
