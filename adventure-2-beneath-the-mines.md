## Funerary Room / Altar to Death

> You find yourselves in a largeish square room, dominated by what is clearly an altar. A long stone block stands in the centre, behind which a 10ft tall statue of **Mictlantecuhtli:** God of death, is down on one knee on a plinth. Emaciated human form with a skull for a head. Golden circlet holds a smaller skull above his head, and an elaborate headdress of dark green and black feathers. Holds a bronze human heart in one hand, and a small, heavily tapered bronze dagger in the other. The plinth says DEATH on it. Smith's body lies on the plinth. His throat has been cut and the blood has run down channels carved in the stone to fill the impression of a skull in the floor in front of the plinth. Alcoves holding smaller statues line the walls:
>
> - **Tlaloc:** God of rain and storms. Vertical blue bands along the alcove wall. What was once a bright blue hawk-headed figure with huge eyes, circled by runes, wears a crown.
> - **Tonatiuh:** God of the sun. Rays emanate from a golden quarter circle in one corner of his alcove. An ape-headed figure stands with an orb in one hand and a bird in the other. A python circles his neck. He sticks out a pointed, triangular tongue inscribed with a golden rune in the form of an eye.
> - **Tezcatlipoca:** *The Smoking Mirror* - God of night. Alcove is jet black, slightly mirrored. Obsidian-skinned figure with the head and claws of a jaguar 
> - **Quetzalcoatl:** *The Feathered Serpent* - Patron of Knowledge and Learning. Silver alcove, Jade serpent figure with a bronze mane of feathers.

## Library

In here, the walls are lined with ancient books. Warrior figures stand on columns, adorned in feathers and carrying large, oval shields and spears. On one wall, a faded mural depicts 'Naji slaughtering their enemies on the battlefield in one scene, sacrificing a line of victims atop a pyramidal temple in another. A DC15 investigation check reveals one particularly interesting book: *The Tenochtitlan Codex*. This talks of a great 'Naji city, Tenochtitlan, and The Fourth Great War with a nation/nations referred to only as the Group/Alliance/Federation (The Consortium). 

A second document (DC17) is, surprisingly, in common, and appears to be a captured Consortium text. It describes the 'Naji from a different perspective: vicious primitives, intent on the destruction, enslavement and sacrifice of all other beings. *If radical action is not taken, this threat is likely to bring about, in a very real sense, the end of the known world. The Consortium therefore concludes radical action must be taken, and we must consider every available option, however distasteful, to face this existential threat.*

DC20 reveals a map of the surrounding area as it was at the time the temple was built

## Orrery/Astronomy Room

This room is different: The walls are curved, as is the ceiling. It is bare save for a small cylindrical pedestal in the centre, upon which rests an orb about the size of two fists, with an odd pattern of circular holes cut into it. Channels run from the fire along the bottom of the walls to the orb in a cross shape. A DC 14 investigation check reveals a small depression in the pedestal. When pressed, the fire rushes up the channels and into the orb. The room goes totally dark, and the purpose of the orb is revealed: the holes project patterns onto the curved walls. A DC 10 Int/History check tells the players that these are probably stars, and 15 tells them that this is an accurate representation of the current night sky. A DC 17 investigation check reveals a small ring under the orb that can be turned with some force and a satisfying *click*. As the ring is turned, tiny cuts open up on the orb, filling in the gaps between the the stars and revealing a set of animal constellations

## Sacrifice Room

Four large stone pillars stand in the corners of this room. A large circular stone altar sits in the centre, surrounded by four statues. Each is in some sort of position of worship, and each holds out a human skull missing its top, reaching towards the gruesome sight above. Andersen hangs suspended between the four columns, frozen with his back arched and face contorted in pain. His torso has been cut open, ribs broken apart and his heart is missing. Blood has poured down his side into the basin below.

Carefully inspecting the figures reveals something isn't quite right about them. Their faces, their expressions, their poses, are all too lifelike. These aren't statues - these were once people.

At the far end of the room is a colossal octagonal door

## Challenge Room: Valour

Upon entering, the PCs see a room with four large alcoves. These are "life-sized" versions of the ones in the Funerary Room: one for each of the four minor gods. **This is a deadly encounter; the party may or may not survive.** If they do not, provided none attempt to flee, they succeed the challenge nevertheless. In either case they awake back in the sacrifice room, with a jewel sitting upon the pedestal of the Valour room.

## Challenge Room: Intellect

ROOM 1: As the PCs enter, they find themselves in tiny room not much larger than a wardrobe. Turning around, they'll find a stone wall. On the wall facing them, it says *To progress, you must retreat*. Walking backwards at the far wall, players will find themselves in room 2

ROOM 2: is a corridor that bends out of sight about 40 ft away. It is an inescapable loop. The corridor is lined with braziers with symbols over them. The floor has an (infinitely repeating) clue written along it, which points to which braziers must be lit to escape the loop. The clue is "*The warriors roar, while the cowards hide in the shadows*". The solution is to light only the braziers corresponding to predatory animals, and leave the others "in the shadows". If the players haven't found the constellations yet, you can persuade them to go back and look for other stuff by giving them the hint that the writing on the previous wall has more than one meaning (go find more information)

ROOM 3: is a vast chasm, with light spilling out of a door far in the distance. It is perfect blackness, apparently infinitely far up and down, and extends to the right and left arbitrarily far. Along the parapet is inscribed *Faith is absolute* over and over. The PCs must take a meaningful step into the void, with all their weight on it, upon which they will discover they can simply walk to the door.

## Main Hall/Throne Room



## Aftermath

> The patrician sighs. *It appears you have averted a catastrophe beyond the scope of anything we had imagined. Guildmaster MAGIC has inspected the area and believes it has been leaking magic into the city for a long time. It is just a theory, but a deeply unsettling one.*
>
> He hesitates at his desk for a moment. *What I am about to show you must under no circumstance reach the citizens of the city. I don't know if the city would survive if it did.* He picks up a large roll of translucent paper and walks over to the fireplace. Above it hangs an ornate map of Haven, showing the districts and some of the main buildings but lacking most of the detail of the modern city.
>
> *This map dates to the founding of the districts and the building of the Furnace, more than 150 years ago.*
>
> Slowly, he unfurls the translucent paper and smooths it out over the map. It shows a drawing of the throne room door you opened.
>
> The central skull lays perfectly over the furnace. Each of the districts aligns with one side of the octagonal door, and one of the promised gifts:
>
> - Reinhardt - *Power*
> - Aleph - *Riches*
> - Underflow - *Conquest*
> - Jura - *Knowledge*
> - Heath - *Protection*
> - Febris - *Plenty*
> - Bast - *Rulership*
> - Lustre - *Desire*
>
> *It seems whatever was under here has been shaping our civilization, possibly since its very inception. I dread to think what the entities below were waiting for, or what they would have done when it arrived. While you seem to have eliminated the immediate danger, I doubt this is the last we will hear of the 'Naji. We must remain vigilant, always. The city is in your debt.*
