# Adventure 3: Whispers in Haven

## Hook

Following the discovery of the necropolis, the patrician informs Soldan that he’s heard reports the SKRC has contracted the Whispers for an operation in Haven, and that two of their agents appear to already be in the city. He asks Sol to investigate. 

That evening, Yosston gives Sol a note he’s found, claiming someone was waving it around in a pub. It appears to be encyphered, containing groups of 3 numbers. He recognises this as a book cypher, but, interestingly, it also has some writing in the bottom-left corner - *HACH*

## Lines of investigation

This is an unstructured investigation. The players have *many* lines of inquiry, essentially limited by their own creativity. I will attempt to detail as many of them as possible here, but some improvisation will almost certainly be required.

### Enciphered message

This will likely be the first line of investigation. The puzzle here is to divine the meaning of the writing on the message; this is the key to deciphering it. Book cyphers show no pattern and are impenetrable without the source text. In this case, the source text is *Haven: A Complete History* by Finnias Lancethrope. Copies are readily available in any relevant library and many bookshops (hence the choice). 

Simply asking a bookseller or librarian about *HACH* will provoke a long list of *hatch* related book titles, eg

- *Hatching eggs: a beginner’s guide*
- *The bible of cross-hatching techniques*
- *How to hatch dragonchess plans*

When deciphered, the note reads

> *The system here is watertight: there's no way I'm going to be able to steal one, let alone several. We'll have to delay while I collect pieces instead. I've ripped out a few and nobody has noticed, our friend tinkered with the imp. This is getting dangerous - start working on our out. It sounds like you have plenty already.*

### City Records

As the agents are Drow, the players may want to check the city registry for Drow that have entered the city in the past few months. Andrew McGill will confirm there aren’t any - in fact, no new Drow have entered the city in a long time.

### Gossip

Asking around in different places will reveal a few different clues:

- **Freya** will report she’s heard the lifts running at odd hours. She’s come out of her house a few times to check, and has found it apparently moving with nothing on it.
- **Lilac** will report a large number of new people using the library, each showing up for a day, asking about a specific book, reading it for a few hours, but not checking it out, and not returning.
- **Twice** will report he’s seen a drow woman sweet-talking a sailor (Warda). She seemed too young/attractive for him. Dressed like a mechanic.
- **Thabian** has had someone Zesstra ask him if he can make mech fuel; a very odd question given that they run on magic
- **Donovan/Powell** have seen Zesstra about, but don’t know much more than anyone else about her.
- **Maestra Duppel** has heard of the sailor going missing, and turning up in the Passage
- **Cora**‘s found pages missing from a textbook and complained to Lilac, who couldn’t tell anything was wrong
- **Aleos/Epimetheus** have found a wilderness map missing from the Trilateral Library
- **Hariad**‘s experiments have been producing odd results sometimes, as if distorted by a powerful illusion field
- **Rengar** is having problems with missing blueprints 
- **Suriel** will report that Orens never received the manifests that Torvald sent over, and is requesting he provide a new copy

### Direct Search

Having gathered enough information to figure out what is going on (to a greater or lesser extent), the players will probably want to do some looking about for the culprits directly.

#### Accommodation

A search of abandoned homes in Hearth will eventually reveal one that is clearly inhabited. There are documents *everywhere* - book pages, maps, MEC blueprints scattered over a rough hewn table. Two bedrolls occupy opposite corners of the room, with a small pile of clothes next to each.

There’s a clue to the pair’s dead-drop locations in the city

#### Dead-drops

Substitution cypher?

- One about blueprints
- One reply to the 1st one about acquiring a boat

#### Stake-outs

- Staking out the library over several days will reveal a few apparently different characters all doing the same thing: Talking to Lilac, taking a book, reading it for a while, then leaving.

  - Watching them closely, they can be caught neatly (and quickly) cutting pages from the books

  - This requires deception/stealth, or they’ll be noticed
- Staking out the *house*, the group will see Kored and Zesstra arriving/leaving at different times
  - These will require high perception/good coverage, *and* high stealth.
  - Not enough perception => agents enter/exit unseen
  - Not enough stealth => agents see players (consequences), don’t enter
- Sitting in Reinhardt, the players will observe Zesstra going back and forth, chatting to people and carrying packages.
  - Deception/stealth is required here not to be noticed
  - She’s carrying a sling bag containing blueprints

## Consequences

If the agents notice the players’ investigation, they will initiate an abort sequence.

### Kored

If discovered, Kored will get out of sight, disguise himself as someone else, and flee. Kored is a [college of whispers bard](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/HyXFUJ0HWb).

- The house in Hearth will move and become more difficult to find
- He will not return to any libraries, instead waiting for extraction in the house
- A new dead-drop will appear telling Zesstra it’s time to go
- From this point, the group have one night (two full days) before the agents attempt to escape via the docks

### Zesstra

If discovered, Zesstra will misty step out of sight and run. Zesstra is a deadly hunter (Nerzugal’s Extended Bestiary)

- The house in Hearth will move and become more difficult to find
- She will not return to Reinhardt
- She will return to the docks once that night to secure a boat
- A new dead-drop will appear telling Kored it’s time to go
- The pair will attempt to escape the following night

## Escape

Zesstra and Kored have stolen a boat and hidden it in a cave. There’s a basilisk guarding a box containing a large selection of documents, blueprints, manifests, book pages, etc. It also contains 300 gold

Kored is wearing **Mariner’s Splint Armour** and a **Dark Shard Amulet**. He carries **Flux**, a +1 longsword that, when it scores a critical hit against an enemy, forces them to pass a dc 8 + att mod strength saving throw or be knocked prone.

Zesstra is carrying a **shortbow of warning** and wearing **boots of false tracks**



There are two DC 14 (19) portable dart traps set up - dc 13 dex save, 2d6 damage

## Complications

The players have entered the cave, and found Zesstra. She will try her best to escape, and will fight otherwise. When she gets low on health, she'll pull a necklace from her neck with a small round ruby in it. It will send a pulse through the air back towards Haven, notifying Kored of her fate. She then puts it in her mouth and it explodes, killing her.
