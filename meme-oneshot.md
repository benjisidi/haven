## Scene One

Location: The town of *Stonks*

The mad Loxodon artificer known only as *Tusk* has placed a curse on the Shibe race, causing them to only be able to speak the phrase "Hodl". As the players enter the town, *Bets*, a blond halfling in a pinstriped suit, informs the players that the mayor of Stonks, a rock giant with diamond hands called Defuva, wishes to see them. He wants to contract the adventurers to find Tusk and remove the curse. Defuva can't go after Tusk himself, since Tusk has provided the city's transport system, a network of self-pulling carriages.
