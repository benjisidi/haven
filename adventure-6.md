# Session 6: Arrival at Clear Crossing

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

### Twister [ Henri ]

### Soldan [ Cian ]

### Torvald [ Truman ]

## Strong Start

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

The adventure starts with saving **Alfhild** (“Fighting elf/Warrior of the elves/battle of the elves”) from a wolf pack. She has been hunting, tracking an elk for days, and had ended up far from the town.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1: Meet Chief Eirik

### Scene 2: Meet Artok

- 

### Scene 3: Winternights Festival

- Start of the **Wild Hunt**. 
- Divination/Shamanic fortelling of the coming winter
- ~Samhain, lots of fire
- References to the struggle between death and life, light and darkness
- Activities!
  - Fire-breathing/juggling/tricks - general spectacle you are encouraged to contribute to (flair your character!)
  - Tests of **strength** -  wrestling, log splitting, weight lifting
  - Tests of **skill** - 
  - Fortune telling - Artok tells the children of fate to see him later, if he hasn’t already
  - Coal/fire walking
- Sacrifice (goat)

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. The struggle the Children are currently embroiled in repeats in cycles; the details varying slightly with each repetition
2. The cycle is a result of Death’s interest in the material plane. Other divine entities dare not intervene for fear of breaking a fragile peace
3. The Aspects of Evil are Death’s generals/lieutenants - Sorrow, Terror, Hatred and Rage
4. The players are incarnations of heroes from various important points in the last cycle
   1. Sci is the discoverer of the first Fragment
   2. Twister is in fact a survivor of the original Ironclad
   3. Sol is the Inalin member who hid a fragment in the shadowfell
   4. Torvald is a hero of the seige of Themisson’s Deep
5. Alfhild has got far from CC as there is less and less hunting available
6. Undead have begun to attack the town regularly
7. **Somehting something chief’s daughter or something corrupted and is now a necro in the tower**
8. There’s a magical/godly/nonsensical structure up in the mountain. A great fortress that is both mighty and takes up no space. Can only be seen when you’re looking right at it.
9. Arathys and Drex are long-serving crewmates of Freya’s. They bear the same Dragoon tattoo she does. After a good amount of action and an ill-commanded campaign to secure the Whitespire straits, Freya convinced her crew to defect and took *Fading Twilight* up north, in the hope of finding where so many of the mysterious merchant ships she saw went.
10. Soldan has a vision of the Shadowfell: a huge labyrinth splays out at the foot of a mountain. High above, a series of great towers is built into its side. The fringes of the vision are played by some sort of dark fog, distinct from the darkness of the demiplane. As play progresses, these will continue, with the fog increasing in severity as Sorrow tightens their grip on Shadowfell.
11. There’s a volcano in the Dragonspine mountains up north. It has been silent for a long while, and has recently started to billow smoke again
12. The OverWood was once the centre of a large wood-elf population in Skara. The remains of their great capital can still be found to the north.

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
