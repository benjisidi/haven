- # Session 6: The Great Hunt

  This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

  ## Character Review

  What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

  ### Sci [ Adam ]

  ### Twister [ Henri ]

  ### Soldan [ Cian ]

  ### Torvald [ Truman ]

  ## Strong Start

  What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

  The adventure starts with saving **Alfhild** (“Fighting elf/Warrior of the elves/battle of the elves”) from a wolf pack. She has been hunting, tracking an elk for days, and had ended up far from the town.

  ## Scene Outline

  Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

  ### Scene 1: Meet Chief Eirik

  ### Scene 2: Meet Artok

  - 

  ### Scene 3: Winternights Festival

  - Start of the **Wild Hunt**. 
  - Divination/Shamanic fortelling of the coming winter
  - ~Samhain, lots of fire
  - References to the struggle between death and life, light and darkness
  - Activities!
    - Fire-breathing/juggling/tricks - general spectacle you are encouraged to contribute to (flair your character!)
    - Tests of **strength** -  wrestling, log splitting, weight lifting
    - Tests of **skill** - 
    - Fortune telling - Artok tells the children of fate to see him later, if he hasn’t already
    - Coal/fire walking
  - Sacrifice (goat)

  ## Secrets & Clues

  Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

  1. The struggle the Children are currently embroiled in repeats in cycles; the details varying slightly with each repetition
  2. The cycle is a result of Death’s interest in the material plane. Other divine entities dare not intervene for fear of breaking a fragile peace
  3. The Aspects of Evil are Death’s generals/lieutenants - Sorrow, Terror, Hatred and Rage
  4. The players are incarnations of heroes from various important points in the last cycle
     1. Sci is the discoverer of the first Fragment
     2. Twister is in fact a survivor of the original Ironclad
     3. Sol is the Inalin member who hid a fragment in the shadowfell
     4. Torvald is a hero of the seige of Themisson’s Deep
  5. Alfhild has got far from CC as there is less and less hunting available
  6. Undead have begun to attack the town regularly
  7. **Eirik's mother Eira corrupted and is now a necro in the tower**
  8. There’s a magical/godly/nonsensical structure up in the mountain. A great fortress that is both mighty and takes up no space. Can only be seen when you’re looking right at it.
  9. Soldan has a vision of the Shadowfell: a huge labyrinth splays out at the foot of a mountain. High above, a series of great towers is built into its side. The fringes of the vision are played by some sort of dark fog, distinct from the darkness of the demiplane. As play progresses, these will continue, with the fog increasing in severity as Sorrow tightens their grip on Shadowfell.
  10. There’s a volcano in the Dragonspine mountains up north. It has been silent for a long while, and has recently started to billow smoke again
  11. The OverWood was once the centre of a large wood-elf population in Skara. The remains of their great capital can still be found to the north.

  ## Fantastic Locations

  ## Monsters

  Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

  ## Rewards

  What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.

  ## Eirik's Greeting

  Greetings! We have not had visitors here in a very long time. If you have indeed cleared the passage to the sea, we owe you a great deal. Come, you will dine with me this evening. 

  (to crowd) The gods have sent us a gift! These warriors have done what we could not, and allowed our boats to travel south once more. On the eve of the great hunt, this is surely an omen of better things to come. Our fortunes are about to improve, I can feel it in my bones! (crowd cheers)

  ## Fale Cosmology

  In the beginning, the gods existed in the space between ice and fire, and built themselves a home, Asgard. There for eons, they fought the giants, and continued contentedly to expand their domain. But eventually, Odin grew tired of their existence, and desired to create something new. At his bidding, Thor, with a mighty, strike from Mjolnir, shattered the worldstone that held the void together. From the pieces he drew the for elements, and at their convergence he created the planes of existence. The feywild, the material plane and the shadowfell. To protect them from the elements raging outside, he wrapped them in a fifth material: the ether. Now, Odin looked upon his creations and began to populate them with all kinds of new creatures.

  Unbeknownst to him, Loki, the trickster, was furious with what had happened, having been content with the way things were before the breaking of the void. He stole a piece of the shattered worldstone, and from it fashioned a being whose power rivaled that of a god. The reaper. Through the stone, Loki gave the reaper the power to prevent souls from reaching Valhalla, and bind them to his will. 

  The reaper claimed the material plane as his own, and a war broke out between the reaper and the gods. The remaining pieces of the worldstone were used by both sides to create bastions outside of the battlefield that the inner planes had become. And thus the planes of Law and Chaos were created. Still neither side could gain the upper hand, and eventually Odin, in his wisdom, realized that the only way to defeat the reaper would be to destroy the material plane. 

  Odin could not bring himself to end his creation, and so instead, after achieving a small victory, folded time around it, trapping death in an endless cycle of defeat.
