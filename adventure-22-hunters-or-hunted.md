# Session 22: Hunters or Hunted?

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

### Soldan [ Cian ]

### Torvald [ Truman ]

### Persephone [ Ed ]

## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1:

DRAGON'S GOODBYE

### Scene 2:

WANDERING MERCHANTS

*A cart sits in a rut at the edge of the road. Several of the spokes on one of the wheels have splintered, and it has lurched into a rut on the side of the road. A tattered, empty harness hangs from the front. Two olive-skinned men are arguing while trying to pull it out*.

DEVELOPMENT

- Eavesdropping will tell the players that the two are from the Glittering Sands, that they had a third companion (a red dragonborn named Chara) who is dead
- Proceeding up the road will cause one of the two (Jon) to call for aid, while the other (Laire) tries to shush him and hide
- Talking to them will reveal that they are traders from the glittering sands, that had the idea of going to Kvenland via the Djemorah Pass to pick up some different goods, and arrive at Evenstad with fresher wares. They were recently in Strunah, where one of their party, Chara, vanished. They stayed for a few days to look for her but eventually had to move on. 
- Helping them with the cart (removing it from the rut, fixing the wheel and providing them with some sort of mount) will reward the party with Chara's potion of fire breathing.

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the party help the merchants?

TRANSITION

- Continue the journey up the road, next encounter depends on scene order.

### Scene 3:

JAIL CARAVAN

- Party must choose an ambush location
  - Trees on one side of the road
  - Hill and rocky terrain
  - Riverside

### Scene 4: 

ON THE ROAD

- Guard checkpoint - not looking for the players
- Preacher
- Cold Snap
- Sir Rick, Paladin of The Mindset
- Collection of picked mushrooms lie by a sleeping dwarf
- Aspect of Luck playing three card monte
- Team of Elasmotherum pulling a huge cart train of animals

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. Clue
2. Clue
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
