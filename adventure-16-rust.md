# Session 16: Rust

*Last time: You continued to investigate who might have destroyed Twister's office. You discovered the culprit was Breney Beray, curator of the Monsterous Miscellany, who had become obsessed with creating the perfect creature. You found his abattoir in the museum cellar and tracked his creations into the Haven sewers. Following a chaotic fight with a horrifying, swirling mass of flesh and bones, you find yourselves somewhere under Haven.*

## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

- Empowered Sapphire: Slowly accrue energy from the surrounding magic field and discharge it, causing a magic surge effect on a 5 and causing 2d8 typeless damage in a 15ft radius.
- Hallucinogenic gas: DC16 wis save, suffer effect from table + disadvantage on ability checks for the next 10 mins

### Scene 3:

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. **Soldan's** friends at the Northern Lights have noticed a change in him. **Alotel** tells him *Since you returned from your expedition, it is as if you have grown further from us, and taken a step back towards your old life.*
2. **Mastra Duppel** wants to know what happened to McCowan. Will trade **Sci** for rumours about the museum.
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use. 

## Session Notes

Place anything you need to keep track of and a small summary of events here



- Empowered Sapphires are like capacitors for magic
- **Persephone contracts Tetanus**
- Torvald: -1 AC -4 FO
- Persephone: Ring has 1 rust
- Sol: -4 Damage on Echo, -4 to glaive

- Chars retreat to the boat after the fight and will decide what to do (rest etc)next time
- Persephone has a book about necromancy & cloning
  - *First steps were creating a simulacrum. After that what remained was the mind. Since failed attempts at this stage had far worse consequences, the practice quickly became taboo and progress stalled.*
- There's a Lustre job board
  - There's a 10k GP bounty for anyone who provides the inquisitors with information leading to the arrest of a whisper agent in connection with McCowan's death.
  - Sci added a 0 to the price of one of the jobs - 300->3000 for a security gig
