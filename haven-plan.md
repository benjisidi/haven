# Plan

## Overall story

- Far in the past, the cult of Death grew from a small movement based in the Underdark to an organized movement bent on taking over the continent.

- When the ruling empire proved ineffective at resisting them, several factions formed to oppose the invasion:
  - The **Honoriad** was a religious sect of dwarves and humans (paladins, clerics, etc, worshiping the Norse gods) based in the lateral mountain range between Kvenland and the Glittering Sands. They focused on engineering and martial prowess as their mechanism for resisting the invaders.
  - The **Inalin** was a group of drow and wood-elves who had originally inhabited the Underdark and Overforest north of Kvenland. They comprised of the most powerful magic users in each race.
  - The **Ironclad** were an army of sentient machines built by the Honoriad and Inalin for the sole purpose of fighting the fallen.
  
- During the wars, the Inalin were quickly pushed out of their original home in the north. It was known to be an area rich in magical power, where the demi-planes brushed up against the material one. When all seemed lost, a Tabaxi, **X** and wood-elf **Y**, ventured deep into fallen territory guided by visions of a source of power that would help in the conflict. They discovered the first Divine Fragment - slivers from the creation of the world that grant the user huge power. 

- After this, the war shifted from simply one for territory to a race to find and harness as many fragments as possible. Together, the Inalin and Honoriad consumed the first to create the Ironclad, forming the **League of Three**. It was clear they held far too much power to be left to the devices of empires and kings, much less the enemy, and the League resolved to find and safeguard all of the remaining fragments.

- In the resulting wars, the Ironclad were lost, and the League shattered. The Fallen were defeated, but at the cost of much of Fale. The continent fell into a dark age, with philosophical and technological advancement stagnant. The glory of the past had been lost, seemingly permanently.

- The PCs are the descendants of powerful historical figures, who played important roles in the struggle against the attempts of the ‘Naji (or *fallen*) to dominate Fale:
  - **Twister** is (to the PCs knowledge), the only functioning member of the *Ironclad*. They have lost their memory and do not remember the war. (Flashbacks will provide a useful mechanism for drip-feeding the players information when necessary.)
  - **Soldan** is a descendant of the Inalin, and patron of \_\_\_\_, ruler of Shadowfell
  - **Torvald** is the last of the Honoriad, and patron of Tyr
  - **Sci** is a descendant of the divine explorer - discoverer of the Fragments
  
## Campaign Progression

### Part 1: Haven

The players start in the city and get hints at the resurgence of the Fallen and the threat they pose. They are introduced to **The Skeleton King (Fallen Emperor)** and his four generals, **Sorrow, Terror, Hatred** and **Rage**. The rest of the campaign will be a race to the remaining fragments, fighting the generals and finally the king in an effort to save Fale and prevent the resurgence of the Fallen.

### Part 2: The First Fragment

The players are given a ship and an order to explore the water-ways near the city. They find, much to their surprise, that there are others living in the ice: an Inuit civilisation that is the remnants of the wood-elves that once inhabited the Overforest. Their first encounter is **Clear Crossing**, a small fishing village [ but it soon transpires there’s a much larger settlement further north? ]

The PCs are told undead occasionally wander into the settlement, and that they seem to be coming from the north. There’s a fortress near a volcano up there that seems to be a concentration of the evil that can be found in the frozen waste. Before going there, they must complete a task to prove their worth, and retrieve the ancestral weapon of the champion of the elves. The weapon is **Righteous Dawn**, a greatsword that does + radiant damage with a bonus to undead. This is intended for Torvald, and along the way the rest of the party will find similar loot.

Having obtained the weapon, the group must make the treacherous journey north to the volcano. Embedded in the rock is the **Polytopic Fortress** - a keep built by the Ironclad and bent into higher dimensions resulting in impossible geometry. After the destruction of the Ironclad, it is inhabited by **Terror**, who the PCs will have to fight to cleanse it. **THEME: HALO**

Having cleared the fortress of demons/undead, and defeated Terror, the AI in command of the fortress will be freed (they have been attempting to communicate with the players and glitching out/cut off by Terror [Theme: Nox]). The AI will reveal one of the fragments is stored in the fortress, and while it was kept safe, it has been damaged by Terror attempting to consume it. The players are invited to use what remains to aid them in their fight, and each gain their first Ancestral Feat.

# Ancestral Feats
### Last of the Honoriad: Vengeful Spirit

The blood of powerful holy warriors flows through your veins. Fearsome in battle, you are determined to deliver retribution to those who strike you down.
- Increase your Strength or Constitution modifier by 1. Your maximum score increases accordingly.
- When you take damage that reduces you to 0 hit points, you may use your reaction to make one melee weapon attack before you fall unconscious.
- When you make a death saving throw, on a roll of 18 or more you regain 1 hit point. Once you use this benefit, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest.
- If a creature you can see deals damage to you that reduces you to 0 hit points, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. Additionally, the next time that creature sees you move towards or make an attack against it, it must make a Wisdom saving throw against your passive Charisma (Intimidation). On a failure, the creature becomes frightened for 1 minute. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, end the effect on a success.
- **Tier 2** Your critical hits are suffused with divine fury. They gain the effect of *Divine Smite* at the maximum available level without expending a spell slot.

### Battle AI: Adaptive Shielding

- Increase your Intelligence or Constitution modifier by 1. Your maximum increases accordingly.
- When you are hit by an attack, your AI may use your reaction to redirect a burst of energy to the target, temporarily shielding the area. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack.
