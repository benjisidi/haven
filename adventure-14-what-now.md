## Strong Start

> *Last session, you continued to to investigate Vyncent Sone and his attempt to monopolize the sparkglass in Haven. You secreted your friends away and made preparations to leave the city should things go south. Retreating to your cave for the night, you attacked by Cassandra and a group of assassins. During the fight, Cassandra betrayed her allies and sided with you, explaining afterwards that she was being blackmailed into serving Sone and you were her way out. She promised to teach Persephone a spell in return for dispatching Sone, who she revealed was Bren McCown of McCown imports. She described his strange innate ability to make people do what he wanted.*
>
> *You made your way to the McCown manor in Bast and broke in through a first floor window. Unbeknownst to you, you had been spotted on your way in and McCown was waiting for you with his guards. As the fight wore on, it transpired that the sapphire golem, Shine, that you had previously encountered was in fact McCown. You killed him and spent a while ransacking his manor, where you found a large amount of gold, some incriminating paperwork regarding his sparkglass business, and one of the slivers he used to transform into Shine. Torvald also found some interesting maps showing the shipping lanes that McCown Imports used.*
>
> *As you reconvene at the base of the grand staircase, you hear a knocking on the door....*

An inquisitor has heard the kerfuffle and has come to investigate. Inquisitor **Shapely** knocks on the door. 

## Scene Outline

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. **Torvald's Dream**
3. **Twister's Office** has been destroyed, months of work undone. In the wreckage, there's a note *URGENT...secrets of.../...mechanical dog.../...animated body.../...progress.../...-----ay*
4. The maps from McCowan's imports are different to the rest of Haven's shipping lanes
5. **Soldan's** friends at the Northern Lights have noticed a change in him. **Alotel** tells him *Since you returned from your expedition, it is as if you have grown further from us, and taken a step back towards your old life.*
6. **Mastra Duppel** wants to know what happened to McCowan. Will trade **Sci** for rumours about the museum.
7. 
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

> *You lie floating on a piece of driftwood. Far in the distance, the ice walls of Skara's coast glitter in the setting sun. The arctic water laps gently at your feet and High Protector's cloak where they protrude over the edge of your fragile raft. You're delirious from lack of sleep and water, and your cracked lips and sunburnt face ache. You sit up suddenly as you spot a set of sails on the horizon, having to steady the driftwood as it wobbles under your shifting weight. You blink heavily, and the sails are closer, not more than a mile away. Relief washes over you as you realise you've been saved. Suddenly, a green hand erupts from the water and grasps your ankle, dragging you off the driftwood. An orcish face looms from just beneath the water's surface as you struggle, kicking against its iron grip. You jerk awake, tangled in your bedsheets and breathing heavily.*

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use. 

## Museum Diary Entries

> *The adaptations these creatures have developed in response to their varied surroundings is facinating. So many genius solutions. So many advantages. Next to all this wonderous modifications, our own soft fleshy forms seem oddly fragile. It is humbling.*

> *I'm close to understanding how the basilisk's petrification works! Facinating. Its eyes are too damaged, though. If only I could repair them somehow. I wish I could inspect some _live_ specimens instead of whatever the Guild of Arran bring back, I could learn so much more!*

> *The more I learn and and the more I examine these creatures, the more convinced I become of their superiority. We have powerful minds, but our bodies are weak and pathetic. I've been having vivid, wonderful dreams of bounding through the snow, soaring through the air.... Imagine having the strength of an elasmotherum, the wings of a hippogriff, the speed of a tiger....Wonderous.*

>  I have a new exciting project. So many grand designs. So many ideas. This could be my great contribution to the world. I lack some of the required skills, though. I shall have to improvise for the moment.

> *I've been making progress. The body is finished. I feel less uncetain now. This is my purpose, my destiny. What I was meant to do, why the gods brought me here.*

> *It is almost complete. Just need a few more specimens, and then to make it move. Soon, my lovely, you will have form .The ideal creature. The final shape. Perfect.*

> *Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfe...*
