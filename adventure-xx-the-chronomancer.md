**Scene 1: The Forgotten Tower**

CHRONOMANCER'S TOWER
*Slate grey stones wall the outside of a tall, narrow tower. The vegetation nearby is odd - some are leafless, others have fruit and still others are blooming with flowers. A few of the trees have red-brown autumn leaves. As you walk around the tower, moss and cracks form and disappear in its walls, and the stone shifts from grey to white and back again. There's no door or windows visible anywhere on the structure.*

DEVELOPMENT

- "Time is the key" - something reveals the door. Shadow of a tree at a certain time? A time-like device? Time-related magic? **Something from all four seasons?**

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the players solve the puzzle and open the tower?

TRANSITION

- Go to the Ground Floor

**Scene 2: Ground Floor**

WIZARD'S TOWER GROUND FLOOR
*You enter a cool, high-ceilinged circular room, much larger than the diameter of the tower. Your feet echo off black and white checkboard marble flagstones. On the far side, through a small arch, you can see the start of a stairway.*

DEVELOPMENT

- The room is empty, the players will have to make it to the other side to proceed. They can also leave the tower via the door behind them, which returns them to the clearing.
- Superhot?

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the players reach the stairs?

TRANSITION

- Where do we go next and how do we get there?
