# The Whispers Beneath: Operational Handbook

*The Whispers Beneath* are an organization of Drow whose aim is to restore our rightful status as a sovereign nation. The Overdwellers have subjugated us for too long - it is time to strike back against those that oppress us. To do this, we must acquire sufficient power and influence through subterfuge and sabotage, as we are beginning our campaign from a position of weakness. This document outlines the modus operandi of agents and should be used as a field guide when superior officers are not available.

## Tenets of engagement

- **Leverage**: Never engage head-on. Find a place or time that affords you an advantage. Strike when you are strong, and your target is weak. If such an opportunity cannot be found, find a vulnerable secondary target, such as a relative, and use that to manipulate your opponent into exposing weakness.
- **Location**: In assassination, learn your target. Observe them diligently and carefully plan where to strike. People are most vulnerable where they feel safest. Exploit this. Strike in homes, in castles, behind locked doors. Never in the open, unless absolutely necessary, or publicity is part of the brief. In subterfuge, assimilate into the location. Live as one of its natives, and doors will open for you.
- **Subtlety**: A careful balance must be struck between maintaining the reputation of our organization and preserving anonymity and freedom of movement. Where the two clash, the latter should be your focus. Hiding in plain sight is oftentimes more effective than skulking in the shadows. Where neither is possible, sufficient collateral damage can afford just as good concealment as a dark corner. Do not be afraid to sacrifice civilians and infrastructure to achieve your goals.
- **Priorities**: The brief comes before all else. You are to accomplish your mission regardless of the cost to others, the surrounding society, or yourself. To fail is to besmirch the name of the Whispers. This is not acceptable. Second comes loyalty to the cause. Should you find yourself without command and unable to contact other agents, you will continue to advance the Whispers' cause at every opportunity until you can return for new commands.

## The Five Flaws

- **Recklessness** will lead to your destruction, and, ultimately, that of your brothers and sisters in arms. Consider carefully, plan diligently, and strike decisively.
- **Cowardice** will lead to capture and disgrace. You do not fight for yourself but for all Underdwellers, and to that end you must make whatever sacrifices are required of you.
- **Impetuousness** will lead to provocation. Rather than manipulating your enemy, you are like a puppet, pulled this way and that by the whims of others. The calm hand tugs the strings, and the hot head follows them.
- **Honour** will lead to weakness. Our enemies have afforded us no honour, and we will grand them no mercy in return. Drow are ruthless and effective. Honour is an Overdweller's concept; it has no place in your heart.
- **Empathy** will lead to trouble. Targets, bystanders and teammates are all expendable resources, and you must use them to achieve your tasks. To strike with any less than the full force of what is available to us is to fail before we have begun.

## Command Structure

We are proud of our Drow heritage, and our command structure mimics some of the old Drow society. You will be assigned to an Underhouse, each of which is commanded by a Matron, who will also serve as your Priestess to Lolth. This will serve as your forward operating base. The Whispers are headed by and all ultimately report to Akordia Khalazza, Grand Matron and High Priestess of Lolth. 

> *Sol's mother is the Matron of one of several Underhouses in Evenstad*

Beneath each Matron are several Sisters. One of these will be your direct superior, and it is she who will assign you briefings. Absolute loyalty and obedience are expected, anything less will not be tolerated. You will work together with several other agents, one of whom will be named *Ust Wund Ilthy'eo* (first among equals), or just *Ust*. Your Ust will be responsible for tactical decisions in the field - having been assigned a task by a Sister, they will plan and execute it using their brothers and sisters as they see fit. You are expected to show your Ust the same deference as your Sister and Matron.
