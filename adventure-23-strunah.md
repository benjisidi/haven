# Session 23: Strunah

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

###  [Charlie]

###  [Michael]

### Soldan [ Cian ]

### Torvald [ Truman ]

### Persephone [ Ed ]

## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

*LAST TIME:*

- Said goodbye to Gengar
- Found an ambush point in the abandoned town of *Hollyhead*
- Pulled off a very successful ambush, trapping the convoy between a ditch and a cart and quickly dispatching the Devout
- In the process, Persephone set fire to the cart and some of the surrounding buildings - smoke is now billowing into the air 

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1:

THE CARAVAN

*Opening the prison cart, you see two figures sat facing each other, blank faced, each wearing a thin silvery circlet. A tall, slim man with a bald head, perhaps in his 40s, sits opposite a heavy-set dwarf whose long, braided beard is adorned with many rings and beads. You remove the circlet from the man and he blinks, coming to terms with is surroundings. Seeing is companion, his face twists into a mask of rage and he lunges at him...*

- The bald man is **Jora**, an agent for the Crimson Tide who suspects the Tsar and the pirates have a tacit agreement, allowing Kvenland to steal from the Glittering Sands without outward hostility.
- The dwarf is **Neshara**, who sold out Joren to the Devout in exchange for promises of power/riches.

### Scene 2:

WANDERING MERCHANTS

*A cart sits in a rut at the edge of the road. Several of the spokes on one of the wheels have splintered, and it has lurched into a rut on the side of the road. A tattered, empty harness hangs from the front. Two olive-skinned men are arguing while trying to pull it out*.

DEVELOPMENT

- Eavesdropping will tell the players that the two are from the Glittering Sands, that they had a third companion (a Loxodon named Chara) who is dead
- Proceeding up the road will cause one of the two (Jon) to call for aid, while the other (Laire) tries to shush him and hide
- Talking to them will reveal that they are traders from the glittering sands, that had the idea of going to Kvenland via the Djemorah Pass to pick up some different goods, and arrive at Evenstad with fresher wares. They were recently in Strunah, where one of their party, Chara, vanished. They stayed for a few days to look for her but eventually had to move on. 
- Helping them with the cart (removing it from the rut, fixing the wheel and providing them with some sort of mount) will reward the party with Chara's potion of fire breathing.

### Scene 3:

ON THE ROAD

- Guard checkpoint - not looking for the players
- Preacher
- Cold Snap
- Sir Rick, Paladin of The Mindset
- Collection of picked mushrooms lie by a sleeping dwarf -> Finn al'Seen
  - Monk's Nightcap [Hallucinogen, make you vomit for a while if left uncooked]

- Aspect of Luck playing three card monte
- Team of Elasmotherum pulling a huge cart train of animals

**Scene 4**

THE BAR CRAWL

- **The Ruby Riverbank**: [Orostead Iced Tea](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/comments/mm47uv/the_griffons_saddlebag_orostead_iced_tea_potion/)
- **The Angry Arrow**: *[Snake Oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/comments/wxgi3d/the_griffons_saddlebag_snake_oil_potion/)*
- **The Dark Boar**: Hair of the Bloodhound: Immidiately drunk, but can *see* scents in the air
- **The Carved Gargoyle**: [Whispy Sour](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/comments/etcdj3/the_griffons_saddlebag_wispy_sour_potion/)
- **The Blind Boot**: Titan's Brew: Grow 1d4 inches until the next rest
- **Dueling Devils**: Ethereal Ale/Baldur's Blood Wine
- **Crystal Crown**: King's Tonic (DC 16 Cha save, become a ceramic chicken until next rest on fail)

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. Clue
2. Clue
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

STRUNAH LOCATIONS

- Ruby Riverbank: Crimson Tide HQ and the start of the Strunah pub crawl.

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
