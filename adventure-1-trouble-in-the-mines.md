## Adventure 1: Trouble in the Mines

### Flight to the Cobalt Passage

You leave the island of Fyrkat and continue your journey North. **Cpt. Tanner** chats happily to you, telling stories of huge sea creatures and adventures from his military days. Whenever you ask him where you are headed, he simply replies with "oh, I know just the place". You look dubiously at the unending ice-wall coastline, but you don't have much choice at this point. The days roll by **[ask what the players are doing to pass the time]**. One afternoon, you're sunning yourselves on deck when you hear a cry from the crow's nest: 

> *"Red sails on the horizon, Captain!"*.  

Tanner looks worried
> *Arr, and we were almost there, too. Hold on t' yer britches lads, the ride's about to get mighty rough!*

When asked what's going on, he replies: [Skara - Kvenland Raiding Company]

>*A red flag be the colours of the SKRC - Pirates! And not the happy, friendly kind ye see before ye here. If they do catch us we'll be in a real spot of trouble. Master Longbottom, unfurl the topsails and loosen the jib! Bosun, have the men run out the sweeps. They'll have to catch us first!*

The decks are a flurry of activity, men pulling on ropes and lashing down cargo. Over the sides, you see long, slim oars slide out from the gunports below and begin to row in unison. Looking back over the stern, you see, gaining quickly, a ship much larger than your own, with a tall, intimidating prow and at least 3 gundecks. Tanner sees you looking and hands you his spyglass. Through it you can see the ship's colours clearly: a bright red, outlined cross on a grey-blue field **[Show SKRC flag]**.	

Looking through the spyglass, you see a flash of light and a puff of smoke come from the front of the ship, and a moment later hear the deep *boom* of a cannon. You lower the glass just in time to see the cannonball skit across the waves like a skimming stone, and finally splash into the sea about fifty meters from the ship. A cry once again comes from the lookout

> *They're still gaining on us, Captain!*
>
> *Hold steady lads, we're almost there! We'll outrun them yet.*

The bosun walks downstairs - *Pull harder if you want to live, you bastards!*. You see the sweeps increase in speed. 

> *The Skara-Kvenland Raiding Company are a nasty lot. They've specialised in attacking research vessels, hoping to steal valuable equipment. Not in the habit of taking prisoners, neither.*

Cannonballs continue to skim over the sea, getting ever closer. Just as it seems you are going to be caught, you hear from the captain

> *We've made it! Hard port lads! There be the passage*

`FrostPunk Main Theme`

Off the left side of the boat, you see a fissure in the ice wall, maybe as wide as the boat is long. The boat shudders and jolts as it turns hard to the left, listing heavily as it does. As you pass through the opening a cannon ball crashes into the corner next to you, showering the deck with ice. 

> *Their ships dunnae fit through the pass, though that do mean ours cannae come out to challenge them.*

The passage quickly widens after the entrance and you find yourselves sailing up a large, slow-running river, flanked by ice on either side. It is eerily quiet, and everything is lit with an odd, blue, shimmering glow. 

> *Welcome, land lubbers, to the Cobalt Passage. We'll be arriving at our destination soon, I suggest ye all go gather yer effects*

### Arrival at  the dock 
Soon, you hear "Land Lubbers! Come up on decks! We're about to arrive!"
You see a large cave in the right-hand wall. It is straight-edged, as if it has been cut, rather than weathered. It recedes deep into the ice, and as you turn into it you to your great surprise a dock. There's a handful of fishing ships and a few large war vessels already tethered there. Sailors are walking up and down the piers, using winches and cranes on the quay to load and unload supplies. 

You float up along side a man-o-war that dwarfs the vessel you're on. You're about in line with its middle gundeck. Metal plates have been bolted in places over the stern and inscribed on one of them you seen the name ***Indomitable***. A head appears over the railing and looks down at you with a wide grin

> [British Gangster] *Tanner you dog! It's good to see you again my old friend. Brought us some fresh meat have you?*
>
> *Hader me old friend! What've ye gone an slain this time eh?*
>
> *Plesiosaurus - was attacking our fishing vessels, daft thing*

To your surprise, the man vaults the railing of his ship and slides down a rope onto your deck, landing next to you. He gives Tanner a big hug.

> Ah, you must be the new arrivals! Lovely t' make yer aquaintaince. I'm Hayder. Hayder Hassan, monster hunter and captain of the fine ship you see before you. 

[**Describe Hayder**]

As you disembark, you see sailors pulling a *huge*, four-finned, long-necked body out of a hatch in the aft of the *Indomitable*'s hull.

> Alright land lubbers, I leave ye in the capable hands of **Mistress Alrest**

He gestures to a tall, slim, brown-haired half-elf woman wearing a puffy white shirt tucked into an ankle-length burgundy cotton skirt. A long, ornately handled sabre is hangs from a belt fastened at her waist with a beautiful gilt buckle in the form of an anchor. The shirt's sleeves are rolled up and you can see her muscular forearms are completely sleeved with tattoos of constellations, ships and sea creatures. Off to your right, down the quay, you see a row of warehouses ending in a graving dock where a huge warship is up on stands and a group of people are patching a gash in its hull.

She smiles warmly as you approach

> *Welcome to Haven, travellers. You may call me Freya. We get all sorts arriving here and as dockmaster, one of my responsibilities is to ensure everyone gets a proper welcome. If you'll follow me to my office, we'll get you settled in in no time.*

The office is a spacious, single roomed building walled with fine wood panelling. She sits behind a large, ancient looking wooden desk and gestures to a group of chairs arrayed in front of it. Things to cover:

- Before all else: This is a one-way trip. No leaving with memory of Haven. All agree?
- Guild of Housing and Citizenship should be your first stop - they'll get you somewhere to stay and sort you out with further information and advice about employment.
- Haven is a relaxed and tolerant society, but The Laws are not to be broken **[Distribute Laws]**
- Exchange gold for internal currency - we don't have a ready supply of gold/silver etc, but we have cultivated a large amount of Ironwood, so we use Ironwood tokens as currency:
  - Minor marks (or "minors") are copper
  - Marks are silver
  - Major Marks (or "majors") are gold
  - Great Marks (or "Greats") are platinum
  
  

### The Guild of Housing and Citizenship

Freya leads you down the street, away from the water. You pass a strange looking machine made entirely of a dark-red metal. A large wheel with a thick cable wound around it is attached to an array of pistons. Freya pulls a lever on it as you pass and it hisses as steam vents from the pistons. They begin to pump, and the wheel turns slowly, winding  in the cable. Looking up ahead, you see the lip of a massive crater. Freya turns to you. "Welcome to Haven, travellers", she says with a smile. Behind her, a wide square platform rises slowly into view, hoisted by the cable you saw earlier. You arrive in Hearth **[Describe Hearth]**. Freya leads you to a small humbly built building in the shade below one of the race stands. A sign by the door reads *Guild of Housing and Citizenship*. **[Introduce Andrew McGill]**.

- **Hieronymus**: Go chat to the guys in the Guild of Arran - Bast. McGill seems particularly interested here and sends a note off using HASTE (We were using pigeons, but they kept getting lost in the storms)
- **Taron**: Retired.
- **Hel**: Heads off to Lustre to find some fellow tieflings



### Player introductions

- **Hieronymus** is approached by an inquisitor as he wanders through Hearth who gives him a note:
  *The Patrician kindly requests your presence in Keystone at your earliest convenience*
  - Man walks along pushing a cart that steams the street, melting all the snow

- **Twister**: In the mage testing area, working on their boots. 
  - Elf wearing an elaborate wireframe glove trying to control a duplicate one while a dwarf tweaks it
  - Triton stands arms by his side, hands splayed out looking up at the sky. The snow is melting a few feet from his face.
- **Sol**: Sitting in the *Endless Flagon* with the other members of the *Northern Lights*.
  - In a corner, a dragonborn is taking big gulps of whiskey and spraying out a fine burning mist much to the delight of some patrons.
  - Yosston is playing a game of cards
  - Alotel is chatting to a concerned-looking elven woman who is nodding occasionally at her words
- **Sci**: Studying in the Radiant Hall



### Meeting the Patrician

**[Introduce Patrician's Office]** **[Introduce Patrician]**

> *I have asked you all here to deal with a matter of some sensitivity. I trust I can rely on your discretion.*
>
> *As some of you may know, and others may not, the mines are of considerable importance to the city. Haven has a plentiful supply of coal, but is forced to import metal and other materials, which is, as you can imagine, somewhat inconvenient. We have recently detected traces of metal deep below our main coal mineshaft, and begun to dig an offshoot to investigate. A couple of weeks ago, a wight was found in the offshoot shaft. We assumed it must have been frozen in the ice, destroyed it, and thought little of it. Ice mining is inherently risky in that way. A couple of days ago, a group of wights was found in the shaft, and since then there have been three disappearances. It's clear there's a more significant problem than we first anticipated, one that must be dealt with urgently.*
>
> *Normally, this sort of thing would be reserved for the Order of Arran, but the surface team are out dealing with a separate threat, two out of three of our naval teams are hunting Plieosaurs, and Hayder's men have only just returned...Though that man will fight just about anything.  In addition, we can't bring heavy weaponry in with us both due to space and because, if someone were to collapse the shaft, say with a cannon (ROLL EYES) it would be calamitous for the city.*
>
> *That leaves me in the unfortunate situation of having to ask citizens (INDICATE PLAYERS) to risk their lives investigating a threat with little support and no knowledge of its nature or extent.*

### Tussle in the mines

The group go to the mines, Hayder joins them there and they move to inspect the offshoot tunnel. A group of wights attack them.
