# Sky Wanderer of Mirror Lake (Sci)

## Background

Wandered the planes, watching caravans and bartering for coin.

SKRC had Tabaxi hides as trophies.

Finds people with memories wiped, weird consistencies in the stories - almost sounds like theyâ€™re parroting the same story.

Weirdly affluent area on the coast. Stowed aboard of the merchant ships. On discovery, it became clear you had a genuine thirst for knowledge, and brought you to Haven.
