## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. **Soldan's** friends at the Northern Lights have noticed a change in him. **Alotel** tells him *Since you returned from your expedition, it is as if you have grown further from us, and taken a step back towards your old life.*
2. **Mastra Duppel** wants to know what happened to McCowan. Will trade **Sci** for rumours about the museum.
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

- **Armoured Gator**
  - V. High AC
  - Lower AC when flipped
  - Jaw grapple/crush
- **Crustatian Wasp**
  - Amphibious
  - Can Fly
  - Pincers
  - Sting
  - Swarm
- **Dragonfly Ostritch**
  - Super fast ambush predator
  - Claw/Beak attack
- **Mantis Crawler**
  - Poisonous Bite
  - Sharp Claws
- **Beetle Stag**

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use. 



## Museum Diary Entries

> *The adaptations these creatures have developed in response to their varied surroundings is fascinating. So many genius solutions. So many advantages. Next to all this wonderous modifications, our own soft fleshy forms seem oddly fragile. It is humbling.*

> *I'm close to understanding how the basilisk's petrification works! Fascinating. Its eyes are too damaged, though. If only I could repair them somehow. I wish I could inspect some _live_ specimens instead of whatever the Guild of Arran bring back, I could learn so much more!*

> *The more I learn and and the more I examine these creatures, the more convinced I become of their superiority. We have powerful minds, but our bodies are weak and pathetic. I've been having vivid, wonderful dreams of bounding through the snow, soaring through the air.... Imagine having the strength of an elasmotherum, the wings of a hippogriff, the speed of a tiger....Wonderous.*

>  I have a new exciting project. So many grand designs. So many ideas. This could be my great contribution to the world. I lack some of the required skills, though. I shall have to improvise for the moment, until I can find some help.

> *I've been making progress. Each experiment is more successful than the last. I feel less uncetain now. This is my purpose, my destiny. What I was meant to do, why the gods brought me here. The Grand Project is almost complete. The so-called intellectuals here have been ignoring me. I'll show them. I'll show them all.*

> *It is almost complete. Just need a few more specimens, and then to make it move. Soon, my lovely, you will have form .The ideal creature. The final shape. Perfect.*

> *Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfect. Perfe...*

- Sci finds an Elasmotherum hair in Twister's office, and the word "Hubris" on the broken blackboard.
- The group go to see Epimetheus and ask him to identify the hair, he tells them what it is and that the only similar animal is in the Monstrous Miscellany.
- The group investigate the Miscellany, and on their way out see that the curator's name matches Twister's note
- They find more Elasmotherum hair in the office, and Breyney's diary.
- Sci finds the secret bookshelf door down to the cellar, where there's gore and the remains of some of the chimeral creatures, along with a hole leading to the sewers
- The first chimera the group find is the dragonfly ostritch, which leads them deeper into the sewers where they're attacked by the beetle elk, and eventually the crustacean wasp and turtle gator, which almost kills Torvold.
- The group retreat having heard something skittering (the mantis) in the west side of the map
