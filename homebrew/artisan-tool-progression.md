## Smith’s Tools

Basic repairs can be carried out in the field with the toolkit and some scrap material. Advanced repairs and forging require specialised equipment, significant materials and access to a forge and anvil. Advanced repairs cost 30% of the original item. Forging costs 50% of the item value

| Level | Repairs                         | Forging                         |
| ----- | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 1     | Simple Weapons, Tier 1 Armour   |                                 |

## Poisoner’s Kit

Here, levels simply unlock more poisons. Poisons require glassware, a consistent, hot, controlled flame and a desk’s worth of workspace.

| Level | Inhaled | Contact | Injury | Ingested |
| ----- | ------- | ------- | ------ | -------- |
| 1     |         |         |        |          |
| 2     |         |         |        |          |
| 3     |         |         |        |          |
| 4     |         |         |        |          |
| 5     |         |         |        |          |
| 6     |         |         |        |          |
| 7     |         |         |        |          |
| 8     |         |         |        |          |
| 9     |         |         |        |          |



## Alchemist’s tools

Like the poisoner’s kit, this simply unlocks more potions given the correct ingredients. It has the same requirements as creating a poison.

## Disguise Kit

Disguises require familiarity with the subject

| Level | Disguise                 | Imitate |
| ----- | ------------------------ | ------- |
| 1     | Same build and race      |         |
| 2     | Small variations in size |         |
| 3     |                          |         |
| 4     | Similar races            |         |
| 5     |                          |         |
| 6     |                          |         |
| 7     |                          |         |
|       |                          |         |
|       |                          |         |



## Thieves’ tools

Thieves’ tools can be used to open locks, but lockpicks aren’t the only thing in a thief’s toolkit. Concealments, distractions, forced entry - all are possible with the right gear.

| Level | Locks | Concealment | Forced Entry |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- | ------------ |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
|       |       |             |              |
