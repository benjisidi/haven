## Hazard Details

### Immuring Sleet

Immuring sleet falls as rain, but freezes into masses of ice the instant it touches an object or creature. Creatures caught out in the open without shelter must attempt a DC 15 Fort save once every hour.

A creature which has failed one saving throw is covered with masses of ice, and is slowed. A slowed creature can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). It moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment). Additionally, it takes a -1 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.

A creature which fails a second saving throw becomes frozen to the ground, and is immobilized. It cannot move, and can take only a single standard action each turn. Additionally, it takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls, AC, and Reflex saves.

A creature which fails a third saving throw becomes trapped within solid ice, and is paralyzed. A paralyzed creature is unable to move or act. It has effective Dexterity and Strength scores of 0 and is helpless, but can take purely mental actions.

A creature which fails a fourth saving throw becomes completely entombed within a large mass of solid ice, and dies.

Sleet reduces visibility by half, imposing a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It also imposes a -4 penalty on Listen checks and ranged weapon attacks.

Sleet automatically extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and has a 75% chance to extinguish these lights.

A day of immuring sleet leaves 1d6 inches of solid ice on the ground. Creatures walking on ice must spend 2 squares of movement to enter a square covered by ice, and the DC for Balance and Tumble checks increases by +5.

### Snow

**Snow:** Snow reduces visibility by half, imposing a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It also imposes a -4 penalty on Listen checks and ranged weapon attacks.

A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.

### Leaden Snow

**Leaden Snow:** Leaden snow appears to be normal snow, but is far heavier. Objects beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of damage per inch of snowfall. Creatures beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a creature falls unconscious beneath leaden show, it takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (DC 15 Constitution check negates) each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

Snow reduces visibility by half, imposing a -4 penalty on Spot and Search checks. It also imposes a -4 penalty on Listen checks. Leaden snow makes ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

A day of snowfall leaves 1d6 inches of snow on the ground. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.

### Leaden Snowstorm

**Leaden Snowstorm:** Leaden snow appears to be normal snow, but is far heavier. Objects beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of damage per inch of snowfall. Creatures beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a creature falls unconscious beneath leaden show, it takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (DC 15 Constitution check negates) each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

The combined effects of precipitation and wind reduce visibility by three quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks. Leaden snowstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, even those using siege weapons.

Snowstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.

Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Fort save or be blown away (Small or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Medium; prone), or checked (Large or Huge; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).

Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Medium or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Large), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Huge or Gargantuan).

In addition, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.

### Leaden Hailstorm

**Leaden Hailstorm:** Leaden snow appears to be normal snow, but is far heavier. Objects beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of damage per inch of snowfall. Creatures beneath leaden snow take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per minute. If a creature falls unconscious beneath leaden show, it takes 1d6 points of lethal damage (DC 15 Constitution check negates) each minute thereafter until freed or dead.

The combined effects of precipitation and wind reduce visibility by three quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks. Leaden snowstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, even those using siege weapons.

Snowstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.

Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Fort save or be blown away (Small or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Medium; prone), or checked (Large or Huge; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).

Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Medium or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Large), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Huge or Gargantuan).

In addition, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.

### Fog

**Fog:** Whether in the form of a low-lying cloud or a mist rising from the ground, fog obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).

### Celestial Clarity

**Celestial Clarity:** The sky is a perfect azure blue, colors seem more vibrant, and details appear sharper. Celestial clarity grants a +4 bonus to Spot, Search, Listen, and Sense Motive checks. It also negates any fear or confusion effects.

### Blizzard

**Blizzard:** The combination of high winds, heavy snow (typically 1d3 feet), and bitter cold make blizzards deadly for all who are unprepared for them.

Blizzards reduce visibility to zero, making Spot, Search, and Listen checks and all ranged weapon attacks impossible. All sight, including darkvision, is obscured beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment (attacks by or against them have a 20% miss chance).

Blizzards automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They have a 75% chance to extinguish protected flames, such as those of lanterns.

Creatures must succeed on a DC 18 Fort save or be blown away (Small or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Medium; prone), or checked (Large or Huge; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).

Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Medium or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Large), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Huge or Gargantuan).

In addition, blizzards leave 1d3 feet of heavy snow on the ground afterward. It costs 4 squares of movement to enter a square covered with heavy snow. A blizzard may result in snowdrifts 1d4 x 5 feet deep, especially in and around objects big enough to deflect the wind -- a cabin or a large tent, for instance.

### Snowstorm

**Snowstorm:** The combined effects of precipitation and wind reduce visibility by three quarters, imposing a -8 penalty on Spot, Search, and Listen checks. Snowstorms make ranged weapon attacks impossible, except for those using siege weapons, which suffer a -4 penalty on attack rolls.

Snowstorms automatically extinguish candles, torches, and similar unprotected flames. They cause protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to dance wildly and have a 50% chance to extinguish these lights.

Creatures must succeed on a DC 15 Fort save or be blown away (Tiny or smaller creatures; knocked prone and rolled 1d4 x 10 feet, taking 1d4 points of nonlethal damage per 10 feet), knocked down (Small; prone), or checked (Medium; unable to move forward against the force of the wind).

Airborne creatures are instead blown back 2d6 x 10 feet and dealt 2d6 points of nonlethal damage due to battering and buffeting (Small or smaller creatures), blown back 1d6 x 10 feet (Medium), or blown back 1d6 x 5 feet (Large).

In addition, snowstorms leave 1d6 inches of snow on the ground afterward. It costs 2 squares of movement to enter a snow-covered square.

## Other environmental hazards

### Avalanches

Avalanches can occur in areas where snow piles up on a slope, such as a mountain. When battle in an area with avalanche potential occurs roll a d4 at the end of each round of combat. On the roll of a 1 the avalanche covers a 30-foot-square area. Creatures in the area must make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. Creatures who fail take 14 (4d6) cold damage and 14 (4d6) bludgeoning damage and are knocked prone and restrained. A prone creature cannot stand until it ends the restrained condition by using its action to make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or another unrestrained creature uses its action to dig out the restrained creature ending the restrained condition. Creatures who succeed take only half damage and are knocked prone, but not restrained. The area where the avalanche occurred is considered difficult terrain and you stop rolling to see if an avalanche occurs at the end of each round.

### Broken Ground

Broken ground is any uneven floor such as the craggy, cracked floor of an earthquake ruined temple or a forest floor eroded by the roots of trees. Creatures moving across broken ground can move at half speed without any problem. If a creatures moves across broken ground using a speed greater than half, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check or fall prone.

## DMG rules on cold

Whenever the temperature is at or below 0 degrees Fahrenheit, a creature exposed to the cold must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear (thick coats, gloves, and the like) and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
