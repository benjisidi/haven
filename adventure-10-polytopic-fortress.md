## Bridge with exits

- I grow down as I grow up (GOOSE)
- Alive as you but without breath,
  As cold in my life as in my death;
  Never a thirst though I always drink,
  Dressed in mail but never a clink. (FISH)

## Time-Bridge

- Large open-air hall with a bridge in the middle
- In the past the bridge is intact but there are displacer beasts and it is night
- In the present it is day but the court is in ruins and the bridge is destroyed

## Mirror Room

- A mirror shows how the room existed in the past, quite different to the present. The players must use both to proceed

## Trapped Floor with Riddle

- Engraving shows clues to which floor plaques are safe

## Time-Room/Maze

- Here, rather than jumping between two times, the players must navigate a series of rooms by jumping through _many_ times

## Groundhog day?

- This puzzle is only achievable if you already know whatâ€™s going to happen. The players get many attempts as they keep re-starting at the beginning

## Room of clocks

- There are number-based clues scattered in the lead up to this. Each corresponds to a clock (alarm clock, grandfather clock, box-clock etc), and they must all be set to the correct time to progress

## Gravity-bent corridor

- The corridor appears flat. As you walk away from the entrance, gravity bends and it becomes an incredibly deep hole. Not sure exactly what to do with this one yet.

## Tales from the Yawning Portal

- One of the dungeons in this has a whole host of great ideas
