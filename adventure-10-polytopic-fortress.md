## Recap [*Mountains*]

> _Last week, you were leaving Wisdom's Monastery when a stranger made their way through the door. This was Persephone, a wanderer claiming to have lost their way after a caravan from Haven was attacked. Despite having your doubts about her story, you decided to take her with you, as she was vouched for by Alfhild, who survived your encounter with the avalanche after being hit by and buried in the tangled wreck of a pine tree. You struck out across the plains of magma that cover the area around Mayhem's Peak. After navigating the fields of tar inhabited by unassuming but dangerous tar toads, you made camp at the volcano's base._
>
> _In the morning, you discovered a tunnel, precisely cut into the volcano's side. Venturing inside, you followed a passageway of volcanic glass as it twisted and turned ever downwards, leading you towards the centre of the crater, outrunning a lava flow as you did. You fought your way over a crevasse of congealed magma, past the crabs and elementals living in it, right to the core of the mountain. Here, you found a causeway out onto the lava, leading to a pentagonal slab in the centre. You spotted a rift in the space above the slab, and used the key given to you by Ashira to travel to the room you now stand in._
>
> _It is an exact mirror in of the slab in shape and size, though the white paving stones underfoot and the matching tiles on the walls are cracked and faded. You're surrounded by a faint, persistent tick, tick, tick. Ahead of you is a colossal, semi-circular door, seemingly made entirely of intricate mechanical pieces. The door is a love letter to clockwork, a tapestry of cogs, cams and levers of mind boggling complexity. Looking carefully, you see tiny droplets of blight left on some of the cogs. Across from it, the two opposite walls of the pentagonal room seem to have collapsed, and are obscured by heavy, white and grey rubble. In the centre of the room, at the apex of the pentagon, the same circular repeated pattern shown to you by Ashira is is inscribed on the floor. A pedestal sits inside it, topped with a pentagonal recess._
>
> _Last we left our heroes, Twister had fit the clockwork device from the monastery into the recess and activated the mechanism. As they twist the cogs and levers into place, all of your visions go white, as you're pulled backwards, hard, like someone's trying to rip your insides out through your back. You're tumbling over and over in space, hurtling faster and faster as you spin chaotically round and round. All of this is accompanied by an intense pressure, like your head has been placed in a vice that's getting tighter and tighter until you're sure your eyes are about to explode from their sockets. Then, all at once, it stops._

## Pentagon

> _You land heavily on the floor of the pentagonal room, right where you were standing. Confusingly, you don't seem to have travelled anywhere at all. Upon second inspection though, things seem to have changed. The floor is pristine and uncracked. The rubble is gone, replaced with smooth white walls and two new, much less intricate semi-circular doors, one of which has an intricate mechanism in the wall next to it. Sci, always sharp eyed for shiny things, you notice a sliver of blue gem-like stone scattered in a corner._

When pushed, the doors fall away in two halves leaving an archway.

Placing the sliver in the mechanism plays the [reminiscence](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17tml2bIG-O5sXAi3qAusWPvgFhIoyJwQQbTTzCM7m8o/edit).

## Relativistic Corridor

> _A corridor stretches out ahead of you, about 60ft long and perfectly flat. Like the pentagon, it is white floored and white walled. At the far end, a sliver of blue gemstone lies on the floor._

Space and gravity twist as you progress. The far end is in fact _very_ far away (3000 ft), and as you walk down the corridor, you perceive more and more of its length. It also curves upwards to 90\*, though appears flat to the eye. The trick is to teleport to the far end (or leave one person on the far side of the rubble and jump back to the present). Summoning mage hand at the far side and dropping the fragment would also work.

## Water Room

> _This door leads to _

- Two vats of water with portholes in the sides, facing each other
- As a mechanism turns, two spiralling streams of water shoot out horizontally and collide in the centre
- The streams stop, and an orb of water floats there for a moment, rising slowly
- The effect ends and the water rains down through a grille in the floor.

In one vat lies a sliver of the reminiscence, and three kelpie. In the other, a tablet of _Magnify Gravity_, and a broken part of a tablet of _Reverse Gravity_

## Lorentz Bridge

Crossing this bridge causes the players to shrink to miniscule size. Relative time dilates accordingly. While in this state, all AoE effects hit the whole map, which is only a foot in diameter. On the far side there is a miniature maze, about the size of a shoebox. A pair of _hellwasps_ fly around it. At its centre, protected by a white crystal, is a Reminiscence and Clockwork Heart (from [here](https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LxHkBf1HKzsUfT8YhkN))

## Forge

Two golems stand in a volcanic forge. The sliver of Reminiscence is on the other side of the room.

## Hall of Mirrors

This room's floor and walls are made of burnished bronze. Mirrors are scattered throughout it. Passing through one takes you to a representation of what the place it shows in Fale was like at the time. The Reminiscence is hidden in one of them.

> **"Welcoming" of the drow into Kvenland**
>
> _You are on a dais, in what you recognise as the palace of the Tzar in Kvenland. A tall figure stands just in front of you, in golden yellow robes, facing a crowd of thousands. Their magically amplified voice rings out across the square._
>
> _"Today we welcome our drow friends into the city, and across our empire. We shall not fail them in their time of need. Their home may be gone, but they will make new lives here, in the greatest country in the world. I say to you, treat our subterranean cousins as you would your own family. They have nowhere else to go..."_

> **"Final victory", with representatives of each state**
>
> _You stand at the top of an elegant stone tower, topped by intricately carved archways. Below you a great city sprawls into the distance. Ahead of you, a group of figures stand around a stone table. An orc clad in spiked half-plate leans on a long glaive. Next to him, a mailed dwarf and a drow in deep purple robes converse quietly. On the other side of the table stands one of the Ironclad, a tabaxi in adventuring gear, a triton in a regal blue gown, and a high elf in elaborately decorated plate._
>
> _Abruptly, the orc snaps the head of his glaive and throws it on the table. "It is over, thank the gods. The pattern is complete. I am returning home, to take care of my people." He places a hand on the dwarf's shoulder. "I shall see you at the embassy in Valendal, my friend. Safe travels." As he walks away, he pulls of his spiked vambraces and drops them on the floor without a second look. One by one, the figures wordlessly place their weapons on the table and turn back to the city._

- Jotunheim

> **Creation of the five progenitors**
>
> _You stand atop a mountain. This can't be the duskspires though, Mayhem's Peak is nowhere to be seen. Cool snowmelt trickles gently over your boots. Ahead, the snow is lit by bright orange light that spills from a structure in the mountainside. Five ironclad figures stand before you_

## Forest Room

The corridor ends abruptly, and gives out onto treetops. A forest inhabits the room below, that before your eyes cycles through summer, spring, autumn and winter. Entering the field, PCs have exactly one "year" to find the Reminiscence before finding themselves at the doorway again. **_Attempts age the participant, and rapid aging causes exhaustion_**
