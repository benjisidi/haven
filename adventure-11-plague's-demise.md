## Recap

> *Last we left our heroes, you had made your way through Mayhem's Peak to its very centre, and through the crack in reality you found there, leading you to a space between this plane and Mechanus. Here you found the Polytopic Fortress, a structure you discovered was filled with research and experiments manipulating time and space. A device here seemed to allow you to travel backwards to a specific point, which you later discovered was called a splinter, and explore the Fortress before it was damaged. You discovered that there were originally five Ironclad, created to combat the Aspects that had sided with the great evil. You found the broken pieces of a Reminiscence, a memory stored in a gemstone plate, that showed you two of them in conversation, preparing to make their final stand against the Aspect of Plague. Quintus mentioned the weapon you found buried in Eiur's fort, postulating that those attempting to use it may have required a greater source of power to do so, or that they were unable to destroy Plague's physical form before activating it.
>
> As the reminiscence fades, you now watch as the colossal clockwork vault door folds into the floor, and are greeted by the sight  of a dark room beyond.

## The Portal Room

> *Isaac, why did you give us grief?*
>
> *You do not age, you do not get sick, you do not eat or sleep. Without all this, you would continue to exist, forever, and the lives of mortals around you would soon appear mere fleeting fancies. Grief gives mortal lives meaning. It is what separates you from them.*

> *A rush of intense, vivid images flash before you, too fast to fully comprehend:*
>
> *You're in a tunnel, somewhere underground. The warm, damp air presses against your skin. You inhale, and begin to cough as the acrid smell of burning hair and flesh fills your nostrils. Screams erupt up ahead. There's a rushing sound from behind you, and you're thrown forward as your vision is filled by the bright glare of flames.*
>
> *A city stands before you, towering walls of dark metal and ominous spiked ramparts built into a mountainside. You wipe the dust from your pure white robes and lean on your staff. A sound like a colossal gong crashes through the space around you. The walls begin to crack and tumble. The sound of hundreds of footsteps fills the air.*
>
> *You stand on the top of a hill, surrounded by trees, a light breeze gently ruffling your hair. Through a gap in the canopy, you can see the forest extends far beneath you, all the way to the horizon. You exhale and the air mists in front of you. You begin to walk down the hill, small tendrils of frost creeping from where you place your feet.*
