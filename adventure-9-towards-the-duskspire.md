# Session 9: Towards the Duskspire

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

*What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?* 

### Sci [ Adam ]

Sci wants to learn to use poisons, potions and magic to be a better rogue. He also wants to explore and discover new places, and perhaps find the mysterious travelers toting Tabaxi fur. Adam likes his character succeeding at sneaky/awesome things, and finding epic loot. Their acquaintances are Maestra Druppel in Haven, some fellow students and professors, and an Inquisitor (Artim?). Also a Leonin in the Guild of Arran.

### Twister [ Henri ]

Twister is curious and impatient. They want to discover more about their past and delve into their missing memories. Henri enjoys roleplay, discovering mysteries and tense situations. Their acquaintances are Donovan and Powell, her assistants, assorted faculty and Soldan, with whom they live. Also Helen(?), who was responsible for awakening them.

### Soldan [ Cian ]

Soldan wants to learn more about his patron, and eventually challenge the Whispers, and find out what happened to his friend Perron. Cian enjoys all aspects of DnD and wants to have a balance of them, with lots of opportunities to roleplay and explore his character. His acquaintances are his fellow circus crew, Perron, and Twister, with whom he lives.

### Torvald [ Truman ]

Torvald is moralistic and duty-bound. He wishes to eventually seek vengeance on Skragga, the orc responsible for slaughtering his crew one fateful day. Truman enjoys roleplay and really being able to get into his character. Also hitting things with a spade. His acquaintances are High Protector Orens, his aide, one of his crewmates' brothers, and an old friend of his father.

## Strong Start

*What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.*

The players are just getting ready to leave Clear Crossing. The last person they spoke to was Kana, who told them her daughter, Alfhild was intending to join the party in their expedition north. She has asked that they refuse - Alfhild's father died a few years ago. 

Their preparations become more urgent when a storm is spotted far on the horizon; it could delay their departure for days - time the village does not have. They must leave quickly. Unbeknownst to them, this haste allows Alfhild to stow herself on the ship if possible.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1: The storm.

Skill challenge! There are a number of things that need to be dealt with. DCs are

12 - Excellent solution
14 - Good solution
16 - Adequate solution
18 - Poor solution
20 - Dubious solution/stretch

- **Ice**: A part of the wall has collapsed and an enormous chunk of ice is causing the ship to list. It must be removed. [**Athletics**]
- **Fire**: Lightning strikes the ship! The deck quickly catches and must be extinguished [**Creative**]
- **Topsails**: These need to be taken in completely or the mast is going to crack! Requires climbing the rigging. [**Acrobatics/Slight of Hand**]
- **Belowdecks**: Hatches must be battoned, the cannons need to be latched in place. The hold is flooding and Alfhild is in there! [**Creative/Magic/Athletics**]
- **Anchor chain**: The anchor latch snaps dropping the port-side anchor into the river [**Slight of Hand**]
- **Jib**: The jib needs to be taken in, but the ropes are stuck! Knots need to be untied. [**Intelligence/Athletics**]

Throughout all this, the ship lists and waves hit the deck. Listing = Dex save, Wave = Str save. Failure on the edge throws you into the river.

##### In the river: consequences.

The players should have tied themselves down if they're working on deck. They are towed in the freezing water until another player drags them out with two DC 16 strength checks. Normal drowning rules apply, and they suffer the cold water consequences afterwards.

### Scene 2: The Wyrm and The Tree

The players are padding across the ice when they see geysers. If Alfhild is with them, she will have warned them that this is the sign of a Wyrm. Their only hope is to get off the ice before it catches one of them. Thankfully, this Wyrm is dying having swum through corrupted ice, and its aim isn't very good. Dex save to avoid bite, luck check to avoid debris. Failed luck [1-5] results in con save and 3d6 necrotic damage from the corruption that hits. [6-10] results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage from falling ice. 

The party reach a tree and after circling the Wyrm leaves. The tree turns out to be a [Thornfoul](https://i.redd.it/047qzzos0gw61.jpg), corrupted by the ice. It attacks the players.

### Scene 3: The Frozen Capital

A city in the trees lays splayed out a hundred feet beneath the player's feet. Preserved in the ice, the players can see winding paths, staircases sung into trees, great halls and huddles of smaller buildings connected by winding paths. The buildings have huge holes in them from where the Wyrm has swum through them

### Scene 3.5: Ice Climbers

**Success:** Five Successes before Three Failures. S:II F: IV A:15

**Failure.** With each failure, the PC loses their grip, grabs a loose stone, or didn't properly secure their piton. Larger slabs of stone and ice break free with each failure. The PC is hit by 2d10 damage, and the PC immediately behind them also takes half the same damage.

**Complete Failure.** If the party fails three checks, their successive fumbling and mismanaging of the rock wall causes catastrophic failure. A slab of stone breaks free, dropping them from the wall and crashing atop them for [4/3/2d10]damage. If you want the challenge to be particularly dynamic, you could scale from Setback to Deadly based on how many successes they've accrued (and therefore how far up the wall they are).

The catastrophic collapse lessens the wall's grade, allowing it to be ascended with rope & piton without further risk of failure. The skill challenge is over.

Suggested Skills - DC15-ish

- ***Athletics.*** Through sheer physical prowess, you forge ahead through a particularly challenging section of the climb and anchor a piton beyond to help your companions.
- ***Acrobatics.*** Through a feat of flexibility and balance, you leverage footholds and handholds unreachable by your companions to forge ahead and anchor more pitons.
- ***Nature.*** The PC searches for roots thick and hardy enough to temporarily support a climber's weight.
- ***Survival/Perception/Investigation.*** Succeeding on this check does not count toward the skill challenge. The PC devotes their turn to searching for weak spots in the rock wall that might break free. If the PC succeeds this check, the next PC gets advantage on their check.

**The Yeti.** After the party accrues three successes, a Yeti (abominable or otherwise) appears at the peak. If you want to stay in marching order, assign a number to each player and roll 1d4/1d6. The Yeti moves immediately after the designated player.

The Yeti hurls icy boulders (using the statistics of its Claw attack) from the mountaintop. When the party nears, it uses its Chilling Gaze. If a party member becomes paralyzed, they slip from their rope and the party accrues one failure automatically.

### Scene 3.5 alternative: Avalanche!

**Torvald has blessed Sci, Sol and Twister for the first 2 rounds of avalanche**

#### Pt 1: Chase

- the players start 100 feet away from the avalanche
- Person in front goes first in initiative (avalanche is last)
- You can dash 2+CON modifier times. Each additional dash causes a DC10 Constitution S/T at end of turn. Failure gives exhaustion.
- This chase ends after 5 rounds (DM fiat). You cannot use Stealth to escape from the chase
- The Avalanche acts last. It moves forward 40+Xd20 feet, where X is the number of rounds that has passed. Creatures proficient in survival know how far the avalanche will move next round. If the Avalanche tramples a creature, they take 4d10 bludgeoning damage and become restrained (escape DC10)
- At the end of your turn, roll a D20 on the Complications table. This complication will affect **the next player** at the end of their turn. So you start your turn knowing the complication, and can your action(s) to give yourself a benefit to get past it.

#### Pt 2: Skill challenge

- Main Skills: Athletics, Acrobatics, Survival
- Secondary: Perception, Insight can be used to grant advantage/disadvantage to another player.
- Minor Skills: Nature, History can give two successes
- As usual, if a player has a good argument, they can use any relevant skill. I can also think of a lot of spells and abilities that could give the players successes.
- **Buried:**While buried, you take 1d10 bludgeoning and 1d10 cold damage each time a player makes a skill check. A Perception check must be made to find you and another check to free you from the snow.

### **Scene 4: Altitude Adventure**

As the players begin the climb, the weather improves but it gets colder and the air gets thinner. They must make Con [13] saves to avoid  exhaustion. They come to a ravine, bridged by a rickety construction of mammoth bones. Clouds below hide a small ledge the PCs will hit if they fall, taking damage but not dying (1hp, incapacitated). Perception [16] reveals the *thud*.

Crossing the ravine requires Acrobatics [13]. If more than one person steps on the bridge, the ice at one end will begin to *crack*. 3 people on the bridge breaks it. 

### Scene 4.5: Tix

Tix is an adventurer from the Glittering Sands. They are a Leonin hoping to join the Dark Scarab, the Sultan's elite unit.	

### **Scene 5: Giants!**

The party are ambushed by a **Frost Giant**! A bolder rolls down the side of the ravine they are traversing and blocks the path. A huge figure extricates itself from where it was hidden in the side of the mountain and begins to attack...

**New Session: Recap**

> ​	**Scene 6: White Dragon Monastery**

A sect of white dragonborn monks worship an ancient white dragon. They have no need for food and do not age, and have been here since the armies of yore marched through the pass. They can give the players some lore and supplies if they need them. In particular they tell the players to seek the entrance in the volcano's heart and give them the significance of the puzzles they will find on the other side (the entrance to the polytopic fortress). **Ashira** presides over the monastery and will give twister the pentagonal device and kaleidoscopic key.

**Torvald's Dream**

Torvald finds himself on a misty, cobbled street in Aleph, in the early hours of the morning. A hunched, robed figure hobbles towards him leaning on a stick. Contrasting with his posture, a greatsword is strapped across his back. A scarred, one-eyed face looks up at Torvald from beneath his hood.

> "Who am I, my son?
>
> "And who are *you*"?
>
> Warrior, yes, but when did my wisdom become the idea that you can solve everything with the edge of a spade? *Smacks Torvald with walking stick*
>
> You are a protector, granted, but you can protect your comrades from a great deal more than violence, young man. You can shield them from sorrow, from hatred, even from themselves. You can save best them from violence by preventing violence from occurring at all. To do this you must grow, you must learn. How can you expect to protect others if you have not yet mastered yourself? Observe. Listen. Think. Reach for your weapon only as a last resort. But when you do, do so decisively.

Other names:

- **Adamander**
- ***Soten***
- **Eisho** 
- **Kaizen** 

### Scene 7: Tar Toads

Nearing Mayhem's Peak, the group come across a herd of [Tar Toads](https://i.redd.it/hifsaik6lnn71.jpg). They are happily hopping about on the magma and will spark the tar if the group spook them too much.

### Scene 8: Fire crabs

Encounter

### Scene 9: Lava tunnel/Rickety staircase [mood: frantic]

Descending further into the volcano, the group reach a tunnel with a sharp, uneven obsidian-shard floor. Obsidian stalagmites They're going to have to proceed carefully to get through here unscathed. Examining this in advance (DC14) shows that at some point in the past, lava has dripped into this passageway (foreboding). Further investigation of the chamber reveals a hidden stairwell. 

If the players proceed into the tunnel, the smaller spines crunch underfoot as they enter. The larger ones will cut them. The tunnel winds further and further down into the volcano, towards the centre. As they progress, o

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. Drex/Arathys quite fancy having a ship of their own. They're keen to go pirate hunting once all this is over, if the party are interested.
2. Aspects lore
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Night-time encounters

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

- Northern Lights
- Volcano Erupts
- Wandering Polar Bear

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
