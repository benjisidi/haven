# Session 9: Towards the Duskspire

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

*What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?* 

### Sci [ Adam ]

Sci wants to learn to use poisons, potions and magic to be a better rogue. He also wants to explore and discover new places, and perhaps find the mysterious travelers toting Tabaxi fur. Adam likes his character succeeding at sneaky/awesome things, and finding epic loot. Their acquaintances are Maestra Druppel in Haven, some fellow students and professors, and an Inquisitor (Artim?). Also a Leonin in the Guild of Arran.

### Twister [ Henri ]

Twister is curious and impatient. They want to discover more about their past and delve into their missing memories. Henri enjoys roleplay, discovering mysteries and tense situations. Their acquaintances are Donovan and Powell, her assistants, assorted faculty and Soldan, with whom they live. Also Helen(?), who was responsible for awakening them.

### Soldan [ Cian ]

Soldan wants to learn more about his patron, and eventually challenge the Whispers, and find out what happened to his friend Perron. Cian enjoys all aspects of DnD and wants to have a balance of them, with lots of opportunities to roleplay and explore his character. His acquaintances are his fellow circus crew, Perron, and Twister, with whom he lives.

### Torvald [ Truman ]

Torvald is moralistic and duty-bound. He wishes to eventually seek vengeance on Skragga, the orc responsible for slaughtering his crew one fateful day. Truman enjoys roleplay and really being able to get into his character. Also hitting things with a spade. His acquaintances are High Protector Orens, his aide, one of his crewmates' brothers, and an old friend of his father.

## Strong Start

*What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.*

The players are just getting ready to leave Clear Crossing. The last person they spoke to was Kana, who told them her daughter, Alfhild was intending to join the party in their expedition north. She has asked that they refuse - Alfhild's father died a few years ago. 

Their preparations become more urgent when a storm is spotted far on the horizon; it could delay their departure for days - time the village does not have. They must leave quickly. Unbeknownst to them, this haste allows Alfhild to stow herself on the ship if possible.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1: The storm.

Skill challenge! There are a number of things that need to be dealt with:

- **Ice**: A part of the wall has collapsed and an enormous chunk of ice is causing the ship to list. It must be removed. [**Athletics**]
- **Fire**: Lightning strikes the ship! The deck quickly catches and must be extinguished [**Creative**]
- **Topsails**: These need to be taken in completely or the mast is going to crack! Requires climbing the rigging. [**Acrobatics/Slight of Hand**]
- **Belowdecks**: Hatches must be battoned, the cannons need to be latched in place. The hold is flooding and Alfhild is in there! [**Creative/Magic/Athletics**]
- **Anchor chain**: The anchor latch snaps dropping the port-side anchor into the river [**Slight of Hand**]
- **Jib**: The jib needs to be taken in, but the ropes are stuck! Knots need to be untied. [**Intelligence/Athletics**]

Throughout all this, the ship lists and waves hit the deck. Listing = Dex save, Wave = Str save. Failure on the edge throws you into the river.

### Scene 2: The Wyrm and The Tree

The players are padding across the ice when they see geysers. If Alfhild is with them, she will have warned them that this is the sign of a Wyrm. Their only hope is to get off the ice before it catches one of them. Thankfully, this Wyrm is dying having swum through corrupted ice, and its aim isn't very good. Dex save to avoid bite, luck check to avoid debris. Failed luck [1-5] results in con save and 3d6 necrotic damage from the corruption that hits. [6-10] results in 1d6 bludgeoning damage from falling ice. 

The party reach a tree and after circling the Wyrm leaves. The tree turns out to be a Scythe tree, corrupted by the ice. It attacks the players.

### Scene 3: The Frozen Capital

A city in the trees lays splayed out a hundred feet beneath the player's feet. Preserved in the ice, the players can see winding paths, staircases sung into trees, great halls and huddles of smaller buildings connected by winding paths.

**Scene 4: Altitude Adventure**

As the players begin the climb, the weather improves but it gets colder and the air gets thinner. They must make Con [13] saves to avoid  exhaustion. They come to a ravine, bridged by a rickety construction of mammoth bones. Clouds below hide a small ledge the PCs will hit if they fall, taking damage but not dying (1hp, incapacitated). Perception [16] reveals the *thud*.

Crossing the ravine requires Acrobatics [13]. If more than one person steps on the bridge, the ice at one end will begin to *crack*. 3 people on the bridge breaks it. 

**Scene 5: Giants!**

The party are ambushed by a **Frost Giant**! A bolder rolls down the side of the ravine they are traversing and blocks the path. A huge figure extricates itself from where it was hidden in the side of the mountain and begins to attack...



## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. Clue
2. Clue
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
