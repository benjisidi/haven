  - Lady Fiskabur's journal

    > - Note to self: Lady Arlington in Valendal has somehow got her hands on a Polychroma. I need three. Or maybe just something big and impressive. Will talk to Evolo tomorrow.
    > - I regret letting Evolo sell me that manticore. The upkeep is going to be *terrible*, I'm probably going to have to clip its wings, and it's not even pretty! Definitely not a worthy centerpiece to my collection. Maybe I'll just mount its head in the ballroom instead...
    > - Excited. Approached by some (admittedly distasteful) interesting men today about an exotic opportunity. A real crown jewel of the Fiskabur menagerie, a world first. Arlington can get stuffed, I'll be the talk of the Empire if this bears fruit - the Tsar might even visit! Jahan seems much more amenable than that bitch Tirella, I'm glad he disposed of her. I'll show him around the gardens, take him out to sea, and maybe even convince him to stay a while...He is a bachelor after all.
    > - My new pet arrives next week! I hope those vile men can deliver on their promise, after all the headache it has taken. Maybe I'll tell Arlington about it at the opera.
