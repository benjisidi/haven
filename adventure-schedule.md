# Adventure Schedule

## Planned adventures

- **Adventure 9: Towards the Duskspire**
  - Group sets off from Clear Crossing, encounters a storm on the river, a frozen city, and a wyrm
- **Adventure 10: Into the Mountains**
  - Group arrives at the base of the Duskspire. They must climb ice walls and cross a chasm on a rickety bridge.
  - They are ambushed by a frost giant
  - They find a monastery of white dragonborn monks who give them lore
- **Adventure 11: Mayhem's Peak**
  - Group arrives at the volcano. 
  - Group enters and traverses the Polytopic Fortress' defences
  - Group arrives at the fortress entrance
- **Adventure 12: Plague's Trap**
  - The fortress activates as Twister enters. It replays the Consortium's last stand.
  - At its center, the group find Primus, who has been waiting for them. He says he died that day, and is now Vault.
  - Plague leaks out of Vault and attacks the players as soon as they release the shard (or if they refuse). They must defeat him to claim their ancestral powers!
    - **Twister**: ANSEL is their companion AI.
      - As a bonus action, Twister may roll an intelligence check vs the target's AC. On a success, ANSEL determines one of the target's modifiers, or information about their damage/condition resistances/vulnerabilities/immunities. (x proficiency/day)
      - L2: ANSEL gains defensive/offensive capabilities
    - **Soldan**: Shadowy Terror/Something Else
      - Sol will feel his patron attempting to absorb the divine power through him. If he lets it, he will forgo an ancestral feat for a reward from his patron instead (shadowy terror). Otherwise, he'll get an Inalin-themed ancestral feat
      - Shadowy Terror: At will, you can channel darkness into a room. Light sources dim, and shadows become sharper and more pronounced. Once per day, you may cause these shadows to become terrifying facsimiles of themselves, grotesque and malformed. You gain advantage on intimidation checks while this is active.
      - Something else: You need to come up with a more magically-focused Inalin-themed alternative.
      - Shadow L2: You gain 5 temp. hitpoints at the start of each turn when you are in dim light or darkness. You lose these when you enter bright light.
    - **Torvald**:
      - L2: You are bolstered by the strength of your ancestors. You may continue to act normally at 0hp until you fail a death saving throw.
    - **Sci**: Hyperkeen senses
      - Once per day, you may spend one minute attuning to your hyperkeen senses. For the following minute, you gain a +5 to perception and investigation checks. You can sense dangerous weather an hour before it arrives.
      - L2: Your senses allow you to pinpoint enemy weakpoints, giving you the ability to reroll sneak attack rolls of 1s and 2s. You must use the new roll.
    - **Persephone**: Gifted Sorcerer
      - The tingling sensation through your nerves never *quite* left. Once / day cast *bane* w/o spell slot. 
  - Primus wields a shining greataxe whose blade is made of radiant energy. Maybe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheGriffonsSaddlebag/comments/fce5co/the_griffons_saddlebag_chromatic_obsidian/) as loot?
- **Adventure 13: Home**
  - Having defeated Terror, the PCs return to CC/Haven and have some downtime

## Future Options

- Khadrest's Memoirs style adventure - the party finds an old diary and by reminiscing get teleported to various moments in the author's life 
- Hannah gets captured and the group must infiltrate Rebellion to save her. Torvald can also go after Scragga.
- The Runestone Plateau contains a portal ring which will come in handy later
- An expedition up the eastern coast urgently needed more supplies, and a Research Group party sent to restock them over Titan's Spine have lost contact [this](https://www.thearcanelibrary.com/collections/5th-level/products/the-snow-stalkers) adventure from Arcane Library. The party get to ride Mechs to the mountains!

- A giant city-eating creature is nearing Haven and the Guild of Arran need all the help they can get to deal with it
- Mech racing: piloted edition
- Cpt. Tanner's contact in Sylvana has gone dark.  There's a *lot* of pirate activity, so shipping has stopped for now. The players must make their way south by land and find out what's going on. [Hooks for Sci's hunter nemeses]
- The woods to the south of Skara could be inhabited by [Elasmotherium](https://homebrewery.naturalcrit.com/share/B1r3D9J4NM). The players could be forced to travel south by land due to pirate activity.
