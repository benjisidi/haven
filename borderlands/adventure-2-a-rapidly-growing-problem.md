# Adventure 2: A Rapidly Growing Problem

## Prequel: ANTS!

The Western Road
*The Western Road is a long, dusty path joining Lleni and Djemorah. It waxes and wanes, in places little more than a dirt track, in others a wide, paved highway.*

DEVELOPMENT

- Passing through a wooded section of the path on their way to Ramkiln, the players see a rustle of movement ahead. An ant the size of a large dog clatters across the path, shortly followed by several more. In the opposite direction, several more emerge dragging the carcass of a deer.

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the players attack the ants?

TRANSITION

- The PCs continue their journey to Ramkiln.

> SIDEBAR
>
> The PCs may choose to follow the ants rather than proceeding to the village. If they do, they'll encounter some soldiers and more workers near the colony.

## Scene 1: Village Refugees

RAMKILN
*This is a farming town, with fields of Chou stretching for a mile beyond its borders. A tent-village has set up on the outskirts, where tired, worried-looking villagers gather around small fires. The town square is a large, paved area with a raised section for meetings and speeches. A discussion is going on there.*

DEVELOPMENT

- The town mayor (**Eamon Rewis**) is giving a speech, asking the inhabitants of the town to welcome the refugees in their time of need, and reassuring them that someone will be along soon to restore their village. He spots Clegg and invites him up on stage. ("Not to worry ladies and gents, we've got one of the best in the business. You tell em', Clegg")
- The PCs are addressed by **Phinneas Ferb**, inventor extraordinaire. He points out his lab, on top of a nearby hill, and offers to sell the party a **Enhanced Potion of Growth** for 320gp. (Other inventory: Potion of Hair Growth (40gp), Chromatic Skin (30gp), Climing (140gp), Gaseous Form (300gp))

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the PCs buy Phinneas' potion?

TRANSITION

- The PCs will next head to the village of Loggerhead to confront the ogres.

## Scene 2: Disgruntled Ogres

Loggerhead
*Loggerhead's most notable feature is the two large sawmills on its eastern side. The buildings here are all log walls and thatched roofs, in contrast to the stone and slate of Ramkiln.*

DEVELOPMENT

- Two ogres are standing guard on the road as the PCs approach, **Wallop** and **Butcher**. They will be confrontational, and attack if threatened. If persuaded or bribed, they'll bring the PCs to the tribe's elder, **Churn**.
- Churn explains that their old home was cursed, and so they've taken the village as their new home. He'll refuse to elaborate, simply shaking his head and repeating "cursed".

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the players attack thxe village, or try to help?

TRANSITION

- From here, the players can either return to Ramkiln and gather forces to attack the village (in which case they'll meet Phinneas again), or proceed to the ogre's original home, now the ant hive.

## Scene 3: Ogre Village

AREA X
*The ogre village is unrecognizable. Bits and pieces of the palisade wall litter the ground, making it difficult terrain. The houses have been torn down and built into a single huge structure up against the side of the hill. Large and small ants scurry everywhere*

DEVELOPMENT

- The outskirts of the hill are defended by several soldiers and swarms of smaller ants. The PCs have several choices: fight their way inside and kill the queen, or try to destroy the hive from the outside, which will prompt a huge swarm to exit. They'll have to hold their ground for long enough for the hive to be destroyed (eg burn down)

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- How will the players approach dealing with the hive?

TRANSITION

- Where do we go next and how do we get there?
