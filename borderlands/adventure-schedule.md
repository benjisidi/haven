# Adventure Schedule

- A Djinni is a perfect hard encounter for the group
- Lothos grows *Chou* - a plant that is well suited to the arid temperatures and can be used to make very fine garments.
- A *Vesiculosa* would make a cool encounter at some point
- If the players end up in a noble setting, they can meet the noblewoman "Tess", who is in fact the dragon Tessala in disguise
