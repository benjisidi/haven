# Adventure 3: The Hive

## Ant Pheromones

- **Alarm**: sharp, stinging scent that lingers for quite some time.
  -  This is what the ants emit when they are scared, or highly agitated. The scent of alarm will send any nearby soldiers into an aggressive frenzy until the threat is dealt with. Woe be to any players that get caught up in a cloud of alarm pheromone.
- **Food**: soft, musky scent that does not linger very long.
  - This is a pheromone emitted by workers that have found food. It is a call for other workers to come and help the worker tear apart whatever has been found, and drag it away to the nest.
- **Home**: it mostly smells like vinegar.
  - This pheromone is emitted constantly by all members of the same colony. This pheromone is how ants identify those who belong, and those who do not. 
- **Injury** metallic-acidic smell that lingers.
  - Any injured ant will emit this smell. Soldiers will become very agitated when they sense it; workers will usually attempt to tear the injured ant apart and drag it to the trash heap. The exception to this is when The Queen is injured. Injuries to The Queen will cause workers to repeatedly lick her wounds, and attempt to seal them with salves made of pulp, saliva and earth.
- **Royal**  smells like damp mushrooms.
  - Soldiers in the vicinity of The Queen will be alert and very active. They will repeatedly run their antennae over any individuals near The Queen, to make sure that they smell like friendlies. Workers in the vicinity of royal pheromone are highly active, seeking something to feed or clean.
- **Swarm** a very subtle, rank smell and does not linger very long.
  - This is a pheromone that is emitted by workers when they want other workers to follow them, or come check out what they have found. A more abstract interpretation of this pheromone would be that it is an expression of curiosity.



## The Setup

- **Eamon Rewis** Tells Clagg that those pesky refugees won't leave because their first caravan was set upon by giant ants
  - Argues that the job was to restore the refugees to their home, tries not to pay them
  - 600gp apiece
- **Ederin Pendaloan** came to see Eamon to ask if he could help, is a naturalist who knows alot about ants (Deckard Cain, high elf)
  - He can describe the pheromones to them, has a pet ant colony
  - If they want to synthesize pheromones, they'll need an alchemist
- **Phinneas Ferb** can attempt to make some pheromones, but he'll need a live giant ant
  - Small chance of finding the anthill and the story about the potion of giant growth
- **The Refugees** can direct the players to the location of the attack. If pressed for details, will reveal the ants only attacked them after they wounded a worker, and will give distinction between workers and soldiers

## The Forest

- A line of workers is dragging a boar and a deer through the undergrowth
- Soldiers are running their antennae over the workers and nearby objects
- Seem to be more aware and intelligent than normal ants
- Can follow the ants to the colony

## The Colony

### Outside

- The **Ogre Camp** is by a waterfall and is surrounded by a **rough palisade wall** with a couple of **oversized watchtowers**.
- **Old firepits** and **hide tents** are scattered about
- **Vents** litter the ground
- **Larger entrance** in the side of the cliff-face
- **Workers and soldiers swarming around** will treat the **players as food** unless they've disguised themselves somehow.

**Worker Barracks**

- It is a **very large, expansive room** where workers and soldiers will rest when they are in between jobs for the colony.
- **Honeypots hang upside-down** from the the ceiling in this room (their mouths face the floor).
- Hungry workers will climb on the walls and ceilings to tend to the honeypots, and get sugary paste from them. 
- This is a **very busy room**, with many ants going to and fro; it can be considered “**low security**”, and even soldiers present here will not be on guard (**unless your players begin upsetting the Honeypots**).
- A **large tunnel in the floor** of this room will lead down to **larvae room 2.** At the **far end of this room is a series of large, undesignated rooms** that are multipurpose. Tunnels leading down to the egg room and larvae room 1 can be found in these undesignated areas.

**Multipurpose Rooms**

- These are the two rooms directly beneath entrances A and B. 
- The room near entrance **A is stiflingly hot, and dry**.
- Room **A** might be a place where the **ants dry out meat**, or otherwise utilize the heat that is being vented out of the egg room. 
- Room **B** is simply a **mass gathering room** where the ants **communicate with each other (via pheromones)** before heading out to seek food, water or other resources. Room B is also where **food is distributed by workers** returning from a find. 
  - This room should be should be **crowded and smelly.**

**Heat Vent**

- This is a l**ong tunnel that leads straight down** from Room A **into the Egg Room**.
- The Ants **sometimes block this tunnel with collections of debris**, and mulchy-paper-saliva glue so that the egg room can be warmed.
- Usually, **the tunnel is open, and gusts of hot, damp air blow up** this tunnel and out of Entrance A.
- Your players may attempt to climb down this tunnel, but it **may be difficult if the updrafts are particularly strong**. They may also find that the tunnel is blocked with logs, branches and insect paper.
- Unless workers are actively working to block or unblock this tunnel, **it should be free of ants**.

**Larvae Room 1**

- This room, like the egg room, is **kept very warm**, but the temperature is not as highly regulated as the egg room.
- In this room, **hundreds of larvae squirm about on the ground**, or in **alcoves in the wall**.
- **Workers bustle about the room**, feeding the increasingly hungry larvae, and **eating the cast-off pupae** that the larvae leave behind.
- Depending upon the different foods and pheromones that these larvae are exposed to, they will develop into a different specialized caste.
- Once the larvae are about the size of a small dog, and have begun **their final pupation**, the workers will take them **to Larvae Room 2**.

**Larvae Room 2**

- In this room, **ant pupae are stacked wall-to-wall**, awaiting the emergence of the final, adult form of the young ants.
- This room is filled with a **damp, earthy smell coming up from the “Shroom Room”.**
- Young worker ants that only recently pupated will be put to work in the shroom room. 
- This is a **fairly low-security room**; soldiers do seem to care very much about what is going on in this room.
- However, the players may encounter **recently pupated soldiers who edgy**, and not particularly well socialized.

**Shroom Room**

- If there are myconids in this room, there should also be **several “fungal workers”, in various states of growth progressio**n.
- The Myconids will **not be hostile** to the players, unless they **percieve the players to be a threat to the colony**. If a threat to the colony is perceived, the Myconids will attempt to halt the players at all costs. 
- There is **large hole** in the “Shroom Room” that leads to the **colony’s trash heap**.
- There are **dozens of vents** that allow warm air to flow out from The Queen’s Chamber into the Shroom Room;
- these vents are small enough that **only a “Small” or smaller creature might fit**.
- A faction of Myconids that **wish to be free from the rule of The Ants**. They may aid your players into reaching The Queen.

**Trash Heap**

- This room is a **gigantic pile of refuse, offal and discarded ant corpses**.
- It is **extremely low-security**.
- It may be inhabited by **injured/dying ants, oozes**, or fungal ants that have become infectious, sterile and aberrant.
- Depending upon the CR level that you wish to run, this refuse heap may be inhabited by a **Roper**, Nothic or other cave-dwelling aberration.
- There should be **no healthy ants** inside the trash heap, but streams of workers on their way to deposit trash may be found.

**Egg Room**

- This is the room where **newly-laid eggs are incubated**.
- Clusters of **football-sized eggs are glued to the walls, floor and ceiling** by ant saliva. 
- This room is **swarming with workers** who clean the eggs and tend to compost heaps that generate heat to warm the room.
- The ants are **very particular** about regulating the **temperature** of this room, so as to foster optimal egg growth.
- There is a **very large vent-tunnel** in this room, that is occasionally blocked with debris, or held open, to adjust the temperature of the room.
- **Soldiers** in this area would be **highly suspicious** of anyone who approaches a cluster of eggs.
- When an **egg gets close to hatching**, workers will take it **into Larvae Room 1**.
- Because this room is so close to the Queen’s Chamber, **soldiers will be somewhat on-edge** in this room.
- If players approach the **tunnel leading towards The Queen’s Chamber**, the **soldiers may become agitated** and very curious about what the players are up to.

**Queen's Tunnel**

- This tunnel should be **packed with Soldiers**.
- It is **extremely high-**security, and they will **not allow anyone to enter The Queen’s Chamber** if they **do not smell like a worker**.
- Additionally, if the players have any **lingering scents of Myconid** on them, the **soldiers will become highly agitated**, as Myconids are NOT allowed near The Queen.
- There should be a **steady stream of workers carrying food** into The Queen’s Chamber, and **eggs out** of the chamber.

**The Queen’s Chamber**

- This is the room where The Queen is kept. This room is kept **very clean**, so as to minimize infectious agents near The Queen.
- **Workers and soldiers constantly swarm The Queen**, cleaning her, feeding her and carrying away the eggs that she is constantly laying.
- The swarm of activity keeps this room **very warm**, which is why the **walls are pockmarked with vents** that **lead into the Shroom Room**. 
- **Soldiers in this room will constantly scan workers** (and the players) with their antennae, and **attack anything that smells amiss**.

## Castes

- **Worker:** Roughly the size of a large dog. Generally will not attack players, unless provoked. Will voraciously eat mushrooms, sugary substances and anything bloody. If provoked, they will fight back. If injured, they will emit alarm and injury pheromone. If they find something that they consider to be food, they will emit swarm pheromone. The most numerous ant by far.

- **Special Worker (Honeypot):** These are workers that have been overstuffed with food, and act as living food repositories. Their abdomens are grossly swollen; up to 5-6x the size of a normal worker ant. They are fairly helpless and unable to move as a result of their weight. Honeypots hang from the ceiling, and regurgitate liquid, sugary paste at the request of other ants. A single honeypot usually has 2-6 soldiers nearby. Honeypots will explode if their abdomens are injured; this can be very dangerous for anyone that gets the sugar paste on them (Consider the area of effect like that of a *fireball* spell).

- **Special Worker (Fungal Worker):** These are workers that have been infected with Myconid reproductive spores. These spores grow very slowly, and allow the ant to perceive the Myconid spore-based communication, and facilitates cooperation between the Ant colony, and the Myconid tribe. When the reproductive spores inevitably take over all brain functions of this worker, it will seek out the colony’s Myconid allies. Within a few days, the worker’s body will shut down, and explode as several young myconids emerge from the corpse. Fungal workers can be distinguished by the fungal growths that poke out of their skin at irregular intervals. Fungal workers are NEVER allowed near The Queen.

- **Soldier:** About 2x the size of a worker. Has very large, very sharp mandibles. She will attack anything that smells unfamiliar, or anything that smells like blood. If agitated, she will emit alarm pheromone fairly easily.

- **Special Soldier (Bombardier):** The same size as all the other soldiers. However, its body contains a volatile mixture of chemicals that become very explosive if mixed. When attacking, the ant will turn her rear end toward the target, and hose the target down with a sticky, burning acid. Assign acid damage as you see fit, I recommend looking at the various black dragon breath weapons for ideas on how to scale the damage. If a bombardier is slain by fire, piercing, or acid damage, her body should explode in a shower of indiscriminate acid. Bombardiers are uncommon, and should NEVER be seen near The Queen, or near honeypots. Bombardiers smell faintly of sulphur.

- **Breeders:** Slightly smaller than a worker, and has wings. Will flee from anything that presents a threat. If attacked, they will try to escape and emit copious amounts of alarm pheromone. These are the only ants that are potentially male.

- **Special Breeder (Queen):** The Queen is about 5x the size of a worker ant, or about the size of a horse. The Queen is fairly immobile, and is usually surrounded by a small swarm of workers and soldiers. She is constantly laying eggs and eating. If The Queen emits alarm pheromone, her workers will form a tight ball around her, with their mandibles facing out towards the threat. Meanwhile, her soldiers will become extremely aggressive.
