# Adventure 1: A tale of three dragons

*Modified version of "Dueling Dragons" from Kassoon.com*

## Scene 1: A harried rider

LOTHOS TOWN SQUARE
*Lothos town square is a constant bustle of activity. Merchants cry out deals and offers, raucous laughter can be heard from the Wells, and a constant clatter as carts trundle in and out of the trading town. To the south of the fountain, an auction is taking place, for a **driftglobe** (750gp).*

DEVELOPMENT

- An odd sight; a Tabaxi on a horse, comes thundering through the north gate and into the square. They gallop over to the bounty board and up to the players. If asked, he simply introduces himself as *John*. [He is in fact, Hubert, the young silver dragon that caused all this]

- > [Voice: Mohamed Elshorbagy] *Are you adventurers? Uhh sure I've heard of you, why not. Listen, Azmar is about to be attacked by some giant brutish creatures and I need your help pronto, will you come?*

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the players decide to save Azmar?

TRANSITION

- If the players agree, they'll set off towards Azmar along the North road. Depending on how quickly they get there, they either arrive at the town or its ruins.

## Scene 2: Azmar

AZMAR UNDER ATTACK
*Azmar is a small village, more of a stopping point for travelers along the road to get their horses re-shod while they drink an ale in the tavern. A handful of houses and an inn with a hodge-podge mixture of thatched and slate rooves cluster about a central square of sorts, where a well sits under a large tree.*

DEVELOPMENT

- A hill giant called *Thud* is leading the attack. He is joined by two Ettins, *Grushank* and *Groshound*, and a cyclops called *Splat*.

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- How will the players save the town?

TRANSITION

- Hubert takes on his true form and confesses his motivations to the players. He wanted to have a bit of fun so he decided to take Ughra's prized possession - an egg gifted to him as a peace offering by the last Sultan of the Glittering Sands - and return it to the desert... by adding it to Tessala's hoard instead. He was expecting there to be a bit of a misunderstanding and for Ughra to have to humbly ask for it back, since Tessala is stronger than him, but instead Ughra has vowed to raise an army, march to the desert and kill her. The party need to steal the egg from Tessala and return it.

## Scene 3: Tessala's Lair

TESSALA'S LAIR
*The steppe angles sharply downwards into a colossal crevice. Beneath you, you can see what must have once been a grand structure - the remnants of columns jut jaggedly out of a slowly bubbling pool of tar. The remains of an entranceway are carved into the far wall.* 	

DEVELOPMENT

- The outside of Tessala's lair is covered by a thick layer of tar. Players will need to find a way to cross the gap before entering (the party seems oddly poorly equipped for this...). The tar is difficult terrain, and falling in causes a player to take (2+X)d6 fire damage, where X is the number of turns they have spent in the tar.

- There's a temple door (in fact one from an ancient thieves' guild) blocking the path. The painting to the left and right of it are in fact magical and can be used to manipulate cogs underneath it. In the right place, the pins open and the chains snap free.

- The inside of her lair is simple, and simply but effectively defended. Crossing under the bridge triggers a magical ensnarement trap of Tessala's making. Players must succeed on a DC16 Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the effects from the table. They may repeat the saving throw when they're about to do something harmful and when they take damage. If un-ended, the effects last for 4 hours or until Tessala returns and ends them.

  | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 1    | The PC gets very tired, and decides it's time for a nap. They find a comfortable spot in the cave and go to sleep. |
  | 2    | The PC is infected with a terrible paranoia and sense of impending doom. Shadows in the cave seem to warp and morph, and they feel like they're being watched from somewhere. They want nothing but to leave this place with their friends and go home. |
  | 3    | The PC becomes furious with those around them, leading to aggressive action if the spell isn't dealt with swiftly. |
  | 4    | The PC gets very hot. They decide it's time for a cooling swim in the nice refreshing pool outside... |
  | 5    | The PC becomes giddily happy. They break out food, wine and decide it's time for some relaxation and a bit of a party. |
  | 6    | The PC becomes inordinately fascinated with some small detail or object nearby, and is totally engrossed in examining it. |
  | 7    | The PC forgets who they are, who those around them are, and why they're there in the first place. They look/walk about aimlessly, asking the rest of the party the same questions over and over again. |
  | 8    | The PC is beset by terrible aches and pains that distract them from their current goal. They have an awful migraine and want to find a dark, quiet place to wait it out. |

  | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | 1    | It's been a long day. You're really tired. It's cool and quiet in here - time for a nap. You want to find a comfy looking corner, lay out your bedroll and take a rest. |
  | 2    | You hate this place. It's dark and cold and dank, and it feels like the dark is slowly closing in. Come to think of it, you're pretty sure you're being watched. Something terrible is about to happen. Time to get your friends, and get out. Now. |
  | 3    | These three little shites you're stuck with never fucking shut up. All you want is to take some easy jobs, make some cash and go to the inn. But no, you've got to go traipsing across the desert to some dumbass cave on a mission that doesn't even have any guaranteed pay. It's all their fault, and you've had enough. Time to give them a piece of your mind. |
  | 4    | Sheesh it's hot in here! Your travel clothes are real sweaty, and the air is humid and pressing against your skin. It's really uncomfortable. Come to think of it, there's a nice, refreshing pool of water right outside the cave entrance. A quick dip to cool off sounds lovely right now. |
  | 5    | This is just great, isn't it? On an adventure with all your best pals. Absolutely nowhere else you'd rather be - you're filled with a warm, contented feeling: everything's going to be all right. In fact, this is a pretty nice spot. How about some lunch? Maybe some wine? Game of dice? Let's see where the afternoon takes us. This treasure business can wait. |
  | 6    | Hey, the scratches on that little rock over there are pretty interesting! They might be some sort of writin-ooh is that an ant? Funny seeing ants in a place like thi-Wow, the fibers on my sleeve are so tightly knit together! How do you suppose they manage tha-... |
  | 7    | Why did you come here again? Where IS here, anyway? And who are these weirdos here with you? Come to think of it, who are you? Maybe you should ask one of them... wait, why did you come here again? Where IS here, anyway?... |
  | 8    | Man, your head hurts. The entrance to this cave is really bright, and everyone's talking SO loudly. Urgh, your joints are kind of achy too, and you're a bit light headed. If only the pounding in your head would stop, you'd be able to focus. Maybe if you find a darker, quieter place you can wait for it to pass. All this noise is the last thing you need right now. |

She'll question why they're there, and will show mercy if they can persuade her they're not there to simply rob them. On a particularly good roll (DC23), she will gift them the egg.

*short description for players*

DEVELOPMENT

- The following traps are present in Ughra's lair:
  - Man-Eating plant: Ughra's "treasure chest" isn't trapped. He's locked it rather tightly (DC20 to open), but instead of treasure it contains a *Corpse Flower*. On opening, everyone within 10ft of it must make a DC 16 strength saving throw or be restrained until the end of their next turn.
  - Hunger of Hadar: A pressure plate is carefully concealed in the cave floor (DC18/find/disarm). When activated, *Hunger of Hadar* is cast on the centre of it.
  - Spike wall: 10ft square, DC 16 perception to see tripwire, DC16 thieves' tools to disarm, DC16 dex save to halve 4d10 damage on failure
  - Acid Trap: If you attempt to take treasure from Ughra's lair, the pools of acid begin to boil up and overflow. Time to speed out of there!
