# Session 18: Out to Sea

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table? 

### Sci [ Adam ]

### Twister [ Henri ]

### Soldan [ Cian ]

### Torvald [ Truman ]

### Persephone [ Ed ]

## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

**Scene 1: A Ship Appears**

GHOSTLIGHT’S INVITATION
*short description for players*

DEVELOPMENT

- bullet points describing what the players can do and what the actions are

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the characters board Ghostlight?

TRANSITION

If the characters board Ghostlight, go to  Abandoned Deck. If they don’t, the ship returns  another night and bids them board again, this  time with the help of an illusory sailor who  beckons to them pleadingly from the deck.

**Scene 2: Abandoned Deck**

THE DEATHSPEAKER
*short description for players*

DEVELOPMENT

- The orbs inside the lanterns are will-o’- wisps. Characters can shatter the glass on a successful attack with a bludgeoning  weapon (AC 12). The will-o’- wisps can’t attack or pass  through the lanterns unless  the glass breaks. If  released, they use a Shock  attack against the nearest  target and flee.
-  If characters try to grab the helm, they must  succeed at a DC 20  Strength check to turn  the wheel. Ghostlight’s lanterns flare brightly as  the ship tries to regain  control each round with  an opposed Strength check (+8). 

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the characters board Ghostlight?

TRANSITION

When the characters go through door beneath  the rear deck, they descend a 15-foot, winding  staircase. Go to The Wailing Banshee. 

**Scene 3: Wailing Banshee**

THE WAILING BANSHEE

*A three-level tavern climbs up to the 30- foot high ceiling. Music and revelry fill the air, along with the smell of  roasted meats and hearty ale. Hundreds of green, ghostly sailors  .loat around the room, guzzling  ale and bellowing sea shanties.  Alongside them, a few dozen living  sailors cheer and lift their mugs.    The barkeeps slide free drinks to  the living and dead patrons, as  well as to the surprised new  spirits who materialize on the  barstools.*

DEVELOPMENT

- The Wailing Banshee is a pocket  dimension and tavern inside  Ghostlight. Living passengers  stay here during their voyage, while the  newly dead spend one last day reveling  before being sent on to the afterlife.   
- The proprietor, Darby Grizzlegut, “closes the  tab” at midnight on each new dead soul who  appeared, sending them to either the  Fiddler’s Green or the Galley of the Damned.  
-  For events, rumors, and NPCs in The Wailing  Banshee, see Appendix C: The Tavern.  
-  After a short time, Darby approaches the  characters. Go to Darby’s Request. 

DRAMATIC QUESTION

- Will the characters help Darby?	

TRANSITION

When the characters go through door beneath  the rear deck, they descend a 15-foot, winding  staircase. Go to The Wailing Banshee.

> DARBY GRIZZLEGUT
>
> **Appearance**: A balding dwarf with a brown  beard, one blue eye, and one green eye. Whispers words of comfort and  welcome to dead sailors as he passes them. 

> DARBY'S REQUEST
>
> - The *Ghostlight* has been hijacked 

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

1. Clue
2. Clue
3. Clue
4. Clue
5. Clue
6. Clue
7. Clue
8. Clue
9. Clue
10. Clue

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use. 

## ToDo

- Tovald has several dreams
  - He insists on engaging a pirate ship and gets everyone killed
  - He is a traitor and hands his crew to the pirates in return for freedom
  - His crew mutinies and leaves him for dead
- The Ghostlight is being hijacked by a fiend in service of the Damodred demons, in order to send drowned sailors to the hells instead of where they belong. They are also trying to see if they can produce more ghost ships as a means of invading other parts of Fale and extending their control
- When defeated, Torvald gets to meet one of his crew and learn the truth -> wis save, fail = many versions/a corrupted memory

## Session Notes

Place anything you need to keep track of and a small summary of events here 

> *You stand on the deck of a ship under full sail. It is a hive of activity, sailors running to and fro, their shouts lost in the wind that periodically whips the deck with cold spray. Over your shoulder, you can see a set of red sails not far behind.  The larger ship looms towards you, and the dull boom of cannon echoes off the icy cliffs to your left. You turn and stalk back down the ship to the helm, where a thick set dwarf stands at the wheel.*
>
> - On my mark, bring her about, Thror.
>
> *Thror looks back at you, confused*
>
> - But sir, we can outrun them. We're faster close to the wind
> - Just ***do it!***
>
> *you bark, already making your way belowdecks, calling "Mr Steply!"  as you reach the bottom of the staircase. A grizzled one-eyed sailor in a tricorn stands to attention*
>
> - Action stations Mr Steply! It's time to send this scum to the bottom of the sea
> - *He raises an eyebrow.* We're mighty outgunned, high protector.
> - The gods are with us, Steply. We shall prevail.
> - Alright lads you heard the man. Battle stations, run out the cannon. Step to it now!
>
> You run back up to the helm and with a hand signal instruct Thror to turn the ship. Putting all his weight on the wheel, he turns it as far as it'll go and the ship suddenly lurches into a tight arc. Moments later, there's a cacophany of  the planks beneath your feet shudder as your broadside fires beneath you.

- Faction codebook [whispers] for sol -> has been reading on the ship
- Torvald finds *spearhead* - 3rd rate kvenlandian ship of the line
- Skragga controls fortune and is attacking the southerly coast of the glittering sand
- Torvald is enamoured by lorelei
