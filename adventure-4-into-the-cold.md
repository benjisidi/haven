## Introduction

With Zesstra and Kored pacified, the immediate danger has passed and the group take a few days well-earned R&R in Haven.

### Twister’s Research

Twister does some research into the skeleton king’s words, and uncovers some interesting excerpts in **The Frinarv Slates**. There are tales from Haven’s founding of shadows in the mist around the city. One of the founders eventually went mad and tried to sacrifice another to “the king”, because the shadows told him to. When the mines were first opened a few years later, a plague hit the city and wiped out 20% of the populous. Some of the buried victims didn’t stay dead. 

References to “The King/Emperor” are found in several other texts, including surviving pieces of Thali’s *Histories of Fale* (the name of the continent you’re on). There is repeated mention of his generals ruling over various regions, simply referred to as **Sorrow, Terror, Hatred** and **Rage**.

There’s also mention of the cause of the wars being some objects of power called *fragments*, but not much detail beyond that

### Bar Brawls

- *Soldan*: **Umrak**, a dwarvern engineer that works in Reinhardt and never gets to use his fancy ancestral greataxe. AC 16, str + 4, dex + 0, 50hp 
- *Torvald*: **Borohil**, lithe looking high-elf, member of the winter cavalry. 47hp, dex + 3, str + 1
- *Sci*: **Bura**, Dragonborn. dex + 3, str -1, 40hp

##### 1st fight

Leonid vs Orc - heavyweights. Leonid has upper hand, gets his claws out at one point. Orc comes back with a vicious flurry and finishes the fightx

Tiefling vs Water Genasi - lightweights

### Soldan’s research

Wanting to know more about the amulet, Twister will direct him to *Geirre Allirson*, a professor specialising in different planes and extradimensional travel. He says the amulet is made of ***shadow substance***, material from the shadowfell. 

The shadowfell is an *echo* of the material plane, existing in the border space between here and other planes. It is a desolate place, devoid of light, full of decay and death. There are places in the Underdark where it touches the material plane, and tendrils of shadow substance leak into the material plane. 

There are legends that at some point in the past it was dark but inert/harmless, and that it was corrupted by a powerful undead force.

### More about the Fragments

The group can seek out *Bright*, one of the research group scholars. Bright was a historian before coming to Haven and has lots of peripheral knowledge not associated with the ice/northern regions. He says we do not know *what* divine fragments were, only that they were sources of phenomenal power and that whenever the discovery of one is reported in history, we see a great leap forward for its owners, always followed by war, destruction and death.

## The Trial

Artin finds Sci and tells him the mole has been apprehended, and will shortly be sentenced in the halls of justice. He thinks the party should be there to see it.

The hall is 50ft tall, a grand vaulted ceiling supported by thick marble columns. Eight desks are arranged in a semi-circular fashion, one for each of the guild masters. At the apex stands a ninth desk, at which sits a heavily overweight gnome with dark red hair, golden eyes and dark grey skin. He wears a baggy khaki linen shirt and dungarees. Twister recognises him as **Oppius Congalla**, one of the guild High Artificers with a special interest in military MECs. 

The players stand on a mezzanine high above the proceedings and look down on what’s going on below. The Patrician is also watching, and greets them in hushed tones as they arrive.

> **Oppius: ** *It is an affront that we cower here in the cold while those inbreds live happily in the south. We should be ruling all Fale, not hiding in a glorified ditch! Their armies would fall in a day, do none of you see? If Ching Shih were running things, we’d have control of half of Kvenland by now.*
>
> **Rengar: ** *Enough! The law is clear - the punishment for endangering the city is Protero Memoriae. Let’s banish him and be done with it*
>
> **Ishara**: *Not so fast, Rengar. He is known to the pirates. If we banish him, he will surely fall into their hands. Are we so confident in our memory replacement that we’re willing to provide them so perfect a specimen to attack it?*
>
> **Alyx**: *Ishara is right. I propose we keep him here, in confinement.*
>
> [ Several people speak at once, the trial descends into argument and the Patrician motions the players out of the room ]

## Meeting the founders

> *It would appear that once again the city is in your debt. We’ve been through the documents you recovered and, while it seems they didn’t quite know what they were looking for, they had collected enough that it would have been disastrous had they reached the mainland. You are proving yourselves to be a most capable group, and I may yet have need for your service. Please, come with me. There is someone you should meet.*

He leads the group out of the office, down the hall and up the main stairwell, right to the top of keystone. The floor here is thickly carpeted in a dark grey adorned with patterns in red. In contrast to the marble of the rest of the building, the walls here are wood-panelled and decorated with artwork depicting landscapes in Kvenland. He leads the group to a finely made wooden door, knocks briefly and enters what looks like the living room of a fine apartment. Inside, an elderly-looking dwarf sits in an armchair in front of a fire, reading a book. A side-board holds a fine silver tea-set, currently being poured by an equally elderly looking elf. The elf is tall and slim, with long, dark, pure white hair. His skin is an odd shade, somewhere between the white-grey of the moon High elves and the deep purple-blue of the Drow. As he turns to look at you, you see his eyes are golden.

> “This”, says the patrician, “is Paelias<elf> [**Decard Cain**] and Grimnir<dwarf>.[**Hot fuzz**] The last remaining founders of our great city.

> “Ah!” says Paelias. “Have you brought us visitors, Albert?” 

> “Indeed I have - this is the group who recently dealt with our problem beneath the mines.”

> “Ah yes, of course. Would you take tea on the roof with us? It’s a fine evening.”

After introductions, Paelias leads the group up a final set of stairs and through a small trapdoor, up onto the roof of the building. It’s the end of a bright winter’s day, and the air is clear and crisp. The sun is beginning to set over the lip of the crater, bathing the city in the golden glow filtered through the constant mist that coats the surface.

Paelias slowly walks to the edge to look out of the city, and leans on the railing.

> *I remember when this wasn’t much more than a few makeshift shelters, huddled in a ditch in the ice. So much has changed in that time. It is remarkable that it has survived, really. It has been a constant struggle for survival - it seems that now, for the first time, the city can take a breath. Remarkable.*
>
> *This wasn’t always ice, you know. My father spoke of a time when the north of the continent was lush with forests and life. The Drow and wood-elves occupied much of it. You wanted to know about death worship. Well, his forebears were there at the start. It began in the lowerdark, whispered conversations in quiet places. It grew, and in our folly we did nothing to stop it - like a stain on society nobody was willing to acknowledge. Well, before the end many must’ve wished they had stamped it out. Almost nothing remains on the burning of the underdark, but what does is truly horrific - it’s as if they set the whole sub-continent ablaze in one day. Drow and wood-elf alike were forced south, and it belonged to the Fallen thereafter. Scattered across the surface, we settled into an uneasy existence living side-by-side with humans, and many thought they had escaped the worst of it. But the cult of Mictlantecuhtli followed like a bad dream, springing up in quiet villages and peaceful towns, spreading like a disease.*
>
> *There are tales of a group of Drow - powerful magic users - that came together to fight the spread, but it is all lost to fairy tale and legend now. A great war, shortly before my father was born, obliterated most of the records.*

Grimnir chips in here

> *Aye, me clan had similar tales, a great alliance of humans and dwarves fighting side by side with sword and shield and hammer in the name of the gods against hordes of undead. Spose to have been a great battle at Themison’s Deep, protecting a magic relic dug up by some great explorer or other. Well, that’s where me pa and me are from and I can tell ye, there ain’t no magic there nowadays.* [ Sci is a descendant of Flight of a Dream, the explorer who uncovered the first Divine Relic ]

## Stormchaser

The next morning, Freya summons the group to the docks. She leads them past the wreckage of the store house and up the winding path towards the cave. The group find that the precarious ledge that was once there has been widened into the cliff - it’s now 6ft wide and has a small railing running along it. Arriving in the cave, the group see a number of shafts have been cut into the outer wall, allowing light to spill in from outside. Crates lie strewn around the open area, with a few sailors carrying things in and out.

> “We’ve been hard at work civilising this place. I think it’s coming along nicely. Annoyingly, the waterway is too small for major shipping, and nobody fancies hauling boatloads of fish down that tiny path, so we’ve had to think of a new use for it. Albert is hoping you’ll help us map out some of the inland waterways, see if you can find anything of value - ruins, natural resources, that kind of thing.”

A small jetty has been constructed, linking the main area to the basilisk cave, and juts out into the water. A narrow, finely crafted vessel sits moored there, being seen to by a couple of sailors. 

> *This is **Stormchaser**. She was built as a scout ship a decade ago, when the last Patrician had dreams of a proper navy. Trouble is, she’s not heavily armed enough for combat and too small for merchanting, so we haven’t found much use for her. Won’t find a faster vessel from here to the glittering sands, though. Well, the ship and the crew are yours if you want them, in exchange for whatever intelligence you gather.*

On the ship stands **Kolos**, the Triton you met earlier. He waves from the deck

> *Hail! I was told you might need a navigator, and saw an opportunity to test some of my experiments far from the city. I would be honoured to accompany you, if you’ll have me.*

A female half-elf strides into view behind him, mocking him

> *I would be honoured to accompany you*. Get the wrench out of your arse, Kolos!

She slaps him on the back

> I’m Arathys, first mate of this ***fine*** vessel. When my numbskull brother decides to show up, guess you’ll meet him too. ***Drex! Get up here, captain’s arrived!***

A harried looking male high-elf steps out of a loading hatch in the stern.

> Everything ship-shape and proper captain!
>
> Thank you, Drexel. So, my friends, what do you say?
