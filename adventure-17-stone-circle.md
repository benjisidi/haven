# Session 17: Stone Circle

This is a template for following the planning checklists in *“Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master”*. A short review of what has happened so far goes here.

> *Last time, you left Haven and took Stormchaser up the Cobalt Passage, to the Runestone Plateau - an area seeped in raw magical energy. You were in search of an abandoned Mithril mine and were accosted by the original inhabitant of the mine, a Mithril Wyvern named Elzris. Elzris had been forced out of his home when the miners attracted a hive of rust monsters, killing his brother in the process. He offered you a deal: clear the mine of the monsters and now rust-wyvern, and he would in return retrieve some Mithril and empowered sapphire for you. You've had your first tussle with the rust monsters and returned to the ship for a short rest.*

## Character Review

What do they want? What plays into their backgrounds? What do the players of these characters enjoy at the table?

## Strong Start

**Put the "last time..." script here**

What’s happening? Your start should be rooted in the world. What’s the point? Your start should hook the players into the next stage of the adventure. Where’s the action? Start the players in the middle of an interesting event. If in doubt, start with combat.

## Scene Outline

Outline a short list of scenes that might occur in the story. Prepare only enough to make you feel comfortable. Try to make them sequence agnostic. Be happy to throw them away.

### Scene 1:

### Scene 2:

### Scene 3:

## Secrets & Clues

Write ~10 secrets/clues. **These are the most important feature after strong start**. Each should reveal something about the story/lore/NPCs. They should be spatially and temporally independent. Throw away secrets that don’t come up. Start fresh every time.

## Fantastic Locations

Start with an evocative name. It should bookmark the image of the location in your mind. Use size and age to make locations fantastic. Aim for 1-2/hr of play. For each location, write down three fantastic aspects. Tie locations into character backstories. 

**The Plateau**

The air is thick with raw magic. Every now and then, an environmental effect or creature from another area/plane briefly blinks in and out of existence. The players begin to feel the effects of the charged atmosphere on their persons, getting stronger as they approach the island.

**The Falling Whale**

- Tidal wave of broken ice sweeps the plateau
- Get over or through or around
  - Inside the wave: DC16 STR save 2d6 bludgeoning + 1d6 cold damage/round
  - 2x DC16 checks to escape, or other means

**The Stone Circle**

- Symbols are:
  - Mechanus
  - Feywild
  - Ysgard
  - Pandemonium
  - Abyss
  - Shadowfell
  - Arcadia
  - Hades
- Each pillar has 250hp and AC 17.
- Monsters attack the pillars until attacked and then change target.
- It takes 8 rounds to fully power the circle
- Monsters appear on 1, 3, 5, 7, 9?

## Notable NPCs

Focus on primary NPCs - main contacts, quest givers, notable villains, etc. Keep descriptions brief, and try to link to an archetype from popular fiction. Be prepared to throw them away.

## Monsters

Read monster manuals for inspiration. Choose monsters that make sense for the location/story/situation. Improvise encounters. Spend time building boss fights that account for player abilities rather than negating them. Make a short list of potential encounters and locations. Find some generic maps for the locations.

## Rewards

What’s each character’s loose wish list? Refer to the character review for this. When one fits into the story, drop it into the game. Tie magic items in by using them as the focus for a quest or connection to secret/clue. Unrelated, more common magical items can provide fun situational tools for the PCs to use.
